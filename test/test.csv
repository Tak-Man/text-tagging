0	/dstv-multichoice/reviews/-2501141	???????? On the 12th of April 2018 my DStv account was disconnected because it was in an arrears and my pay date in the 2nd of each month so from the 2nd tp rhe 12th of April I had DSTv access.  On the 29th of April 2018 I paid R1350 to round the figure off because the agent said I need too pay around R1300 and cents. Which I paid because I have a 5year old who is hookes too 303 till 306 but was waiting for a call since the 12th of April 2018 to inform me why I need to pay the full arears amount that initially had to be R949 and not R1300 as my DStv was disconnected and where is the pro rata benefits now because if tables were turn you guys would have wanted your pro rata.  I just then checked my balance and it was not yet updated correctly an the agent Sibubsiso advised that no next payment is only due on 2nd of June 2018 with your normal installment but to my suprise when I checked my balance on my account I need to pay R1206.86 now or R1166.15 on 2nd of June 2018.  Where is this extra R200 coming from I then asked the agent Refilo that said my account was due for R1460.00 and not R1350 as per my payment but this was the information from an Live Chat agent so ***. Anyway so she advised check a week before you need to pay when your account update and if you then have any prpblems contact us. ( really!!! Now!! What service) on top of all of this I asked her if she can see any eacalation anoit the pro rata payment and why I had to pay a full month extra when my DSTV was disconnected and just blankly ignored me... If she was busy with the escalation you need to inform the client that you going to put the client on hold its ettiquete.. what are guys running a Zoo.  Plz dont give my some fake ass excuse and apology.  Give me proper copies of my price lock account to  **********  and please put my money that I am paying for extra in my account.   ********** 111081 S Petersen 429 first avenue Lotus River 7 ********** 873804  August 2018 please  come  Stacey	0	1	0	1	1	1

On Friday the 30th  November 2018 my  24 month contract  for the explorer (price lock) ended. I received an sms from dstv to contact them to activate a new package and they suspended the contract.

Last month DSTV added another R1600 as arrears, this month im on R2700, arrears, yet price lock ended in February 2018, as he confirmed.  Tommorow they will switch it off, and i must pay R2700, to reconnect.  I paid the arrears, in full, they adding still arrears every month.

You debited me over 5000 how yet you supposed to bill about 500 and something. What is that ? Another billing mistake happened last month again.   My debits for rental and insurance are going to bounce due to that and the bank will charge me for that as well. I need this resolved asap my. Please reverse my money back in my account now . I am sick and tired of your incompetence which has affected my bank account since I ended up going to overdrafts and my other debits bouncing which I would have well planned for.  This has occurred several times and I am sick of it. Totally ****ed of. We are all not rich like you to have such mistakes happen in our accounts and not feel the effect. I will also want my bank charges paid when my debits bounce since I know I will see these in my statement soon.  I don't want any stories with you, you really do not see the impact of how your incompetence and numerous mistakes stupid so called system glitches affect me in particular. I just want my money back immediately otherwise I am coming through to your offices and not leaving without it.  Please sort this out immediately and take me off your debit order list.

6	/dstv-multichoice/reviews/1000-rating-deplorable-service-2444564	- 1000 rating! Deplorable Service I have been fighting with DSTV since September 2017 in connection with my account. A few issues I take responsibility for, but the fact that this account is in a mess and no one bothers to call me after I have literally begged for a senior person to call. I am so over this, I actually would love to stop my subscription, the problem being there is no choice in another TV program service with he programs I enjoy! I have never come across such an inability to reconcile an account, pass the relevant transactions and make the customer happy. I am a Financial Manager and have done the recon for them, clearly duplicating the transactions into an excel spread sheet and highlighting the problems, yet I still have not received an updated statement or ledger showing the corrections. Seriously, get your game on DSTV!  I feel so abused by this neglect and firmly believe you should be walking the walk and talking the talk!	1	0	0	1	0	0

8	/dstv-multichoice/reviews/11-jan-2017-2180852	11 Jan 2017 I wanted to disconnect my Xtraview - on the 14th of August. I investigated my monthly invoice via self-service on the website to see if it was worth it. To my surprise I found a DSTV compact and access fee subscription with another smart card on my account? I phoned DSTV immediately. They confirmed that Mohammed an accredited installer phoned in on the 2nd of October 2015 to activate the compact package on my account, obviously without my knowledge. The least they could do was to inform me that my subscription packages changed - I would have been able to query the change, but they didn't. I followed up numerous times as to what is being done about this, to no avail. To date no news after they said they have a turn-around time of 48 hours for issues of this nature. They agreed that their process is flawed with lots of loop holes; they agreed it was not my fault â€“ and they do nothing about it.I want my stolen money back.	0	0	1	1	0	1

I went into the store to make my payment in cash for the connection process and to set up a debit order for the coming months. On the 03rd Feb 2016 they cut my connection due to no payment. I called immediately to find out why they had not processed my payment, only to find out that the consultant who assist with my connection did not enter my details correctly. I asked for an adhock debit order for that evening so I could be reconnected. They advised they were experience technical difficulties and could not assist. I made a payment at Pick n Pay and reconnected myself online. The following day the money was also debited off my account after they advised they could not assist. On Wednesday 10th February I called in connection with processing my refund, they advised I needed to send an email with some personal information which I duly sent. Still no response today I called them to find out what is happening as I haven't even received a response to my email. They now advise it takes 14 days to process a refund and if I want it done quicker I need to reverse the debit order from my side. I find this unacceptable. I want my money returned!	0	0	0	1	1	1
14	/dstv-multichoice/reviews/15-months-of-mess-2375140	15 months of mess Since opening a price lock account with DSTV I have had to deal with nothing but endless issues! I have literally called DSTV every single month about the random amounts that just get debited from my account or don’t go off at all. I have even driven to the Randburg office to make payment arrangements as a result of falling behind because of DSTV failing to take their debit order at all. I have wasted my airtime every time I have called, my petrol driving to Randburg, my bank charges reversing insane debit orders and still after being promised by the DDP line manager last month that my account would be sorted before the debit order went off in October and it is still not sorted! I have asked numerous times for my cancellation figure but no one at DSTV can give that to me either. I am tired of not even being able to budget for every month without knowing how much my DSTV is going to be and the amount of bank charges for reversals that are unnecessary and because of DSTV. I have requested to speak to someone higher than a team leader and this is pretty impossible too!	1	0	0	1	0	0

You requested the proof of payment which I already sent 14th March,so I resent it again and requested you to confirm that you received it. ( I sent to [Email Removed] and your email at [Email Removed] 3) To date, 4 days later, I've received no reply confirming if the proof of payments were received by yourselves,nor is the compact package reactivated without costs as requested. 4) I realize your company has a monopoly with little incentive to provide service, but it really can be no fun for you to deal with angry clients as a result of no service from your colleagues. This is a perfect example of something very easy to resolve in no more than two days, max. Now here we sit, 17 days later, no resolution, no reply, and no active package as requested.  My only conclusion is that you really are pushing your clients to seek alternatives to DSTV. You only need to look at the litany of complaints on this forum alone.

18	/dstv-multichoice/reviews/1hour-conversation-and-no-resulotion-2006534	1Hour conversation and no resulotion  Used DSTV SMS service on the 24/02/16 requesting the amount we need to settle to be reconnect. We received an amount of R524.00 paid, we paid R580.00. No reconnection. We called the call centre on the 24/02/16 and spoke to Gugu who advised that we had to pay another R318.00 to be reconnected. Which we did. They connected us on the night of the 24/02/16 but then Multichoice goes and suspends our account again on the 28/02/16. So after a hectic week we call in today to ask why and if they could reconnect as we though it was a simple problem. This chap Tshepo Kagiso takes the call and straight away my whole experience with DSTV goes horribly wrong for the first time in two decades. Every time we query something with Tshepo, he puts us on hold for 15min a go, only to come back lecturing us on the accounts history but does not once advise us the outstanding amount nor the way forward. One thing I can say is that we have paid R800 + to have 4 days of viewing. I know we sports (rugby & cricket) fans are getting the short end of the stick but this is just ridicules. 1hour telephone conversation with Tshepo and he told me the supervisors are to busy to assist.  	0	1	0	0	1	1

We called everyday to request the status of the request and when the delivery of the new product will be delivered. It was only delivered today 21/12/2018, seven (7) days later and now installation can only be done on 27/12/2018. There is thus no TV service as the old decoder is broken and all they can say is we apologies , but apologies does not get my new decoder installed , and if I did not take there recommendation to take the price lock I would have now had my satellite working.

I've spent over 3 months, 15 phone calls, numerous emails and am still waiting for DSTV to refund me with incorrectly double debited premiums - and adjusted my account with the fixed price lock premiums.   NO one is now returning my calls.  I am leaving message after message...   You call the Call Centre each and time they ask you the story - which takes forever to explain - and at my cost as I'm usually on my cell and 15 calls of some at least 15 minutes and some 30 - these can certainly add up..... Not to mention my frustration and blood pressure levels escalating too with the knowledge that I'm still nowhere !!!   Dstv call centre put you on hold and check your account (while they teammate sense of the 'notes' and then discuss these with a supervisor or transfer you and you start the whole story over again. They all sound so helpful and WANT to help but I believe there is only so much each person can do and only so many times I am prepared to go around and around, banging my head on the wall, over and over expecting a different result.   Then they say they'll get back to you, which they don't.  You have to follow up - because they double debit you again. They then tell you they will escalate the matter. You again hear nothing so....  You follow up - again you get told they'll pull the call logs from the price lock salesman who told me I was to call the accounts department when  I received delivery of my 2x new Explora decoders so I wasn't double charged - as I had purchased two Cash (not year before) and wanted to have the price lock package for 2 years - as I had been a Mnet / DSTV Premium client since their Inception) - and was currently paying near to / around R1150 per month.  2 new decoders with showmax, subs, Insurance etc  would cost me less than that AND I'd escape the next increase in April and next years.....  BUT he was clueless and just wanted the sale....  He could have TOLD me to keep MY Two decoders and pay only R759pm + R99 subs (had he had the proper training and known this) ....  As I said wouldn't be using the new ones till? -  existing ones broker and we're irreparable  - I moved and left these behind - Gave them away ??? Because I had existing which had my taped programmes etc... And DIDN'T want to lose anything and was not going to be ready programming anything.  I made this abundantly clear.   I am at my wurst end trying to sort this out  Dstv eventually collected the two new decoders... Still unused and in their original packaging.  I was advised that the account would be credited and to date this has NOT been done and they are continuing to double deposit it me.   No one at DSTV takes responsibility.  I call and get told they are NOT ALLOWED to transfer me to the price lock department or the people that send me emails.  The people who send me emails don't respond to mine and they put the switchboard number on their email.... The number that won't put me through to them .... So I leave messages with them and they day that they send them AND their managers / supervisors emails regarding my messages and to call me .......  I've left least three messages AND sent 3 emails in the LAST WEEK and even asked them to give me a date and time for me to go in for a meeting at their Randburg office.   STILL NOTHING.  Does anyone work there - other than computers??? Shocking is being nice.   I am owed over R 3 000. If I owed them anything near that I'd have their attorneys hassling me daily.  Be blacklisted.  Have my Dstv service instantly disconnected (only reason I didn't have my bank return it).   Dstv CHECK my account  SORT it out Refund me PLEASE AND reduce all futuroremiu so going do reward in price lock  Also amend smart card numbers as per email.  You have 6 listed on my account. Only 2 are correct. I have given you the other 2 which need to be added as I am paying R70pm insurance and you are covering??? and NOT covering what I have and what's being used....  Records and accounts need updating ASAP.   HUMAN telephonic and written response urgently required.   I'm sure that I will have your standard generic automated computer generated response that advises me you acknowledge my complaint blah blah blah blah ........	0	0	0	1	0	0
29	/dstv-multichoice/reviews/25-years-had-enough-of-dstv-2500672	25 years had enough of DSTV After 25 years I have given up, I can't take the fustrations any more. I have had a premium account and have a debit order in place since I started. When Holiday View first came out, there was problems with payments until everything was paid by the debit order. While moving house in Sep 17 I changed the main decoder address, I switched off in Dec 17 and only put it on in Feb 18 for a few days and later put on permanent before the end of Feb. During March I tried over a 20 times with consultants, web chats and even went to the Dstv agent to try and connect Showmax but no one could understand why not. At the end of March they switched me off, after getting somebody who could help it seems the whole account was now on Holiday View and thats why I couldn't get Showmax. They then switched me off on the 14 March as I now owed R52 on Holiday View and over R900 on our main decoder, this was on Saturday morning and they wanted me to the bank and pay plus send proof of payment. I told them I have always paid by debit order, got to spend 1,5 hours with a supervisor who told me that the debit order had not gone off due to lack of funds which was  total rubbish. The money they took for January was on the main decoder and never used and this could be transferred to the Holiday View which they had now told me was a default as I had switched on during the middle of a month. I arranged an Ad hoc payment for the Monday the 16 th and R52 was only taken on the 18th they then switched me off again and took another R52 the next day. I sent the supervisor an email and left a message for her to call me, which she hasn't done.  To make sure that my debit order was cancelled I went to Centurian walk in, there is no way you can get anything done with an agent. Having sorted out my cancellation with I don't care consultant I spoke to the manager who said they would call me. I'm waiting for the call. Never missing a payment in 25 years of loyalty to DSTV means nothing. If DSTV reply please leave a contract number not just an name.	1	0	0	1	1	0
30	/dstv-multichoice/reviews/2months-and-still-no-refund-2020743	2months and still no refund As per previous complaint, I have cancelled my dstv 2months ago. Two weeks ago I lodged a complaint on hellopeter regarding my Boxoffice refund that has not been paid back yet. After a lot of phone calls and emails, Jackson Nkukane assured me that he will get on to it ASAP.  Your last reply 2 weeks ago was that it will be refunded within 7 days.  I still haven't received my refund. I will now forward all relevant documentation and correspondence between myself and multichoice to my lawyer where I will hold Multichoice responsible for all costs if I don't receive any conformation by the end of business today.	0	0	0	1	0	0
31	/dstv-multichoice/reviews/2nd-double-debit-1983072	2nd Double Debit How does a corporate like Multichoice run it's business if they do not understand the basic principles of accounting in that if you receive 1 item you pay for one not 2. For the 2nd time in a month we have installed an Explora at one of our premises and we have been double debited. once for the old system and once for the new system. When the first incident occurred I got no response from Multichoice so returned my debit order before I was able to solve the problem. I received a call from a Kim Sallie who told me that at any time if I had a query I could contact her so yesterday I sent an EMail to her personal address and am still awaiting a reply. I tried to phone only to be told she does not have an extension on the board So I have once again stopped the payment because it seems as if that is the only way one gets a response. The payment has been returned as an overcharge not R/D so if I have my service disconnected I will take it up with ICASA I have 40 yrs corporate accounting experience and I don't remember ever making these kinds of mistakes and certainly never 2 months in a Plus the installers left the system not working.

Last month i logged a complaint and Linda Magongo called me, she ensured me that she would assist me but i dont get any feedback from her, I sent her 3 emails which she doesn't even reply to, pathetic service . Multichoice messed up my billing, i paid by debit order and they didnt end up debiting, i maid manual payment on time but they still updated my credit report negatively, this has had a very bad impact on my credit record. I even spoke to a Supervisor by the name of Sello Mothoa that advised he will assist but still nothing, I have never experienced such pathetic service, it's like they just do not care. What do I have to do to get this sorted? again i am saying this is messing up my credit record and i want these records removed from the credit bureaus. I cant believe such a huge organisation can have so much incompetent stuff. It's shocking. 	0	0	0	1	0	0

35	/dstv-multichoice/reviews/3-months-of-broken-promises-1989273	3 months of broken promises My first complaint was registered in December 2015. For 3 years we have not received a Dish magazine and Multichoice have lied to us, saying that all magazines are being phased out. I was very encouraged to receive a reply from Dinah promising action. For 3 months since her reply I have been in contact with Multichoice. We have indeed received 2 magazines but both have been 3 weeks late ie we get them towards the END of the month they cover. I am constantly being told that my name is being added to the mailing list but it never happens. HOW HARD CAN THIS BE???? we have 2 full DSTV accounts and pay a fortune every month and yet you cannot get this simple service right. I am disgusted! This is only one of the two issues we have with Multichoice at the moment. I would be very grateful to finally get it sorted.	0	0	0	1	0	0
36	/dstv-multichoice/reviews/3-months-of-contradiction-lies-and-coverups-1965180	3 Months of Contradiction, Lies and Coverups In November 2015, I asked for my Dstv to be cancelled, as I was about to leave the country.  It was cancelled on 16 November 2015 and then I paid a pro-rata amount to cover the service from 1 - 16 November 2015.  During that time, I noticed that an amount of R425.00 was showing as 'outstanding'.  I enquired, only to be told that a payment I made on 26 July 2015, somehow reversed on 7 October, although my bank statements shows contrary.  From that time until mid December 2015, various consultants replied to my emails, contradicting one another. I was asked to send my bank statements, which I did...twice!  Finally, after more than a month, I received an email from Zanele Khumalo on 21 January 2016, informing me \Kindly note that payment was allocated\.  After it didn't reflect on my system, I enquired again, only to be asked for my bank statements, which I again sent.  I then was asked to supply my account number, which I did.  Then they asked why I am sending my bank statements, clearly not reading any of the previous correspondence.  So, after 3 months of contradiction, lies and coverups, the amount of R425.00 has still not been allocated. Look into my correspondence: #723213	1	0	0	1	0	1

Since I upgraded to a higer package in October 2018 it only went of twice and then my service was blocked because the transaction didn’t go through. They’ve even insisted on charging me the reconnection fee where the issue was clearly not on my side.  I spoke to 3 consultants, 3 managers and 2 customer survey consultants. Each one promised to get back to me but didn’t. My issue still hasn’t been resolved! The only way to deal with multichoice is to call them which each time cost me as much as my monthly subscription. Its a monopoly who in the media pride themselves on customer service but in reality is far from it. They refuse to give phone numbers or email adresses so that you can follow up neither can they phone you back.	0	0	0	1	1	0

Round about the 5th of January the service was changedm I phoned dstv and in true dstv style you hold forever and no one answers, I finally got hold of someone who advised me that the system upgraded by itself and they would rectify the issue, my account was dropped to my R99 option the account was going to be rectified. Needless to say this has not happened, I have phoned dstv eat least twice a week to try and resolve the issue as my service is switched off every week, let me see I spend at least R30 worth of airtime e per call and if the call is cut you can't get to the same agent and no one's phones you back.

The 15th of January 2019, I was informed via sms that if I pay my account for three (3) months, they (Dstv) will take care of the fourth  month. In  the 02nd of April 2019, I received another sms, stating that I am still in line to get 1 month on Dstv if I pay April and they will take care of May.  On the 05th of May 2019, my Dstv Services were cut, I called Dstv and spoke to the consultant Itumeleng Moalafi that stated that I must take a screenshot of the sms and mail it to him which I did. The consultant also confirmed that the responsible department will call me back on the same day, which they didnt . I called at past 14h00 on the same day, where another consultant confirm that the responsible department is closed on Sunday however, will switch on my service until the department sort it out and call me.  On Wednesday,08 May 2019,  Dstv switch my service off again due to none payment and the promotions department still did not call me. I called Dstv and spoke to a consultant that was disruptive and rude, I then requested that I spoke to her supervisor, Tanya. I explained to Tanya about the promotion and she asked that I should send the sms again which I informed her that I send to Itumeleng Moalafi. The supervisor said that she will escalate the matter and call me back as soon as possible to sort out the matter. No calls were received and service were not active.  On the 08 May 2019, I called again due to Dstv inability to address the matter and not keeping to their promise as per the promotion. I spoke to another consultant that told me that I am not the only person that lodge this complained (promotion: 4th month free) and will activate my account. She also apologise for the inconvenience.  Today, 14 May 2019, my service is switch off again. I called once more and I was told by the consultant Thobile Tshabalala, after asking me the same questions as the previous consultants, and asking me, once again to send the sms to her so that she, once again can escalate the matter, AGAIN!!! The consultant said that the matter is escalated and that the previous consultants did not load the promotion under my subscription. She promised that they will call me  back again today.  I am waiting for the call again. I am tired of explaining and fighting for something that I was promised by Dstv. What concerned me is that I must explain everytime, does the previous calls and concerns not reflect under my name?  This caused me not to trust any promotions of Dstv, I played my part but when it was there time to deliver (come to the party as they promised), they didn't.

They offered me a deal in February which stated, . Just pay for DStv Premium every month (and on-time) for the next three months and we'll give you the 4th month on us. That's a guaranteed saving of R809. I complied and paid on time all the three months, called them before the 27th of May which is my due date to confirm that the offer still stands and I need not pay for the month of June. They confirmed that yes it stands and their accounts department will credit my account. They have switched off my service three times after that, on the 3rd and 18th reconnecting and charging me reconnection fees. My account is now at R1962.00 whereas I should owe nothing. Today 22nd they switched of my service and when I called I got someone who  kept saying they can’t hear me and I had to drop and call again , I was put on hold on the line for more than 15min and when I finally spoke to the floor manager (Wesley Moodley) he gave me more frustration than assistance , he said he can’t unblock my account even though he can see history of my query and that it was escalated to their accounts department which have not done anything for almost a month. He could not give me a simple thing as a correct call reference. That how unprofessional a floor manager is at DSTV and they think we will feel sorry for the retrenchments?

We called again and they said the first person made an error. Then we connected the extra view decoder and again 4 calls later it was connected. Should this not have been done on the first call. We had to call 7 times for the same activation requests. Really bad service. Spent so much money on calling.	0	0	0	1	0	0

EVERY single month I am being charged a DIFFERENT instalment amount by DStv which I am now TIRED of querying at my telephone cost (usually for a tiring hour on the phone every month, since their staff don't seem efficient enough to assist, especially in terms of English fluency) and they have NO empathy for the escalating costs incurred on me. I receive text message reminders every month as to how much to pay (amounts always fluctuating although my package REMAINS THE SAME) and I pay a few days before the due date to avoid having services suspended as even though payment is due on the 01st of every month, they have in the past already cut the services by the morning of the 01st before I even get a chance to pay. I have disconnected services in the past due to the issues with DStv, but when I later resumed services, I was told that the charges were for reconnection fees which is NOT valid since the services were NOT suspended but disconnected by me. Jan/Feb I spoke to Floyd who guaranteed that he has sorted out their error which will not happen again (AS I AM TOLD BY EACH PERSON EVERY MONTH BUT THIS IS UNDONE THE FOLLOWING MONTH AND THE SAME ISSUE ARISES, STRESSING ME), so I think its best to CUT the cancerous services altogether!!! I am sick and tired of feeling as though these people are THIEVING from me!!! I am on the line with Bradley Mahode who guarantees me that I will receive a call back concerning the escalation but have NO faith in these people! I feel as though it is a huge scam with DStv since for the SAME episodes we are forced to watch for YEARS (REPEATEDLY) there are always some issues! So disgruntled and tired of the rubbish service and they headaches they bring! Do they not make enough money for the rubbish they offer repeatedly for years on end (since they have the monopoly) and we have no alternate choices, that they have to try to extract even more than due from us?????	1	0	0	1	1	0
69	/dstv-multichoice/reviews/a-nightmare-is-an-understatement-2338313	A nightmare is an understatement!! I have been trying to downgrade my package from Premium to Compact since the 2nd of August and cannot believe the amount of effort this turning out to be.  I contact your company via Facebook inbox and the first time, which was on the 2nd of Aug, I was told that downgrades can only be actioned on payment dates I was also told I needed to contact you 4 days before my next payment date. This is already confusing. How can you tell me that downgrades can only be actioned on payment dates, then come back a few minutes later to tell me to contact you 4 days before? Oh by the way, I also asked for the insurance premiums to be cancelled and I have NEVER received feedback.  On the 14th of August I contacted your company again asking to change my payment date because I got a new job and get paid on that date.  Next thing, I'm being told that I will pay R407.81 to cover for my viewing for 1 - 9 September. I argued and asked how that was possible because I was supposed to be downgraded already by that time and should only be paying the prorata amount on my Compact package. The consultant then said I will be charged R223.53 and I agreed to that.  Today, I decided to call your company just to make sure that the right amount will be deducted from account and TO MY UTTER SHOCK I was told that R407.81 was going to be deducted. The consultant I spoke to said she will have to send an e-mail to the person with whom I was last in contact, but cut the line after that.  I have had it with having to run after you JUST TO CHANGE A PAYMENT DATE AND TO DOWNGRADE my package. It is not rocket science and I have given you ample notice of this and WILL NOT allow you to charge me a cent more.  I want a solution to this ASAP.	1	0	0	1	0	1

I spoke to Koagile in the call centre, and was advise that it's my responsibility to phone their insurance department to have the service cancelled, because it's not done when the contract is cancelled. HOW RIDICULOUS IS THIS !?!?!?!! 14 Months I've been paying for Insurance on a ****** decoder i don't even use, and it's my mistake. I was never informed that it's a separate process.  I want my money refunded - R29.50 x 14 months = R413.00 (incl). Yes, I am complaining about R30 a month going off my account.  Thank you  XXXXX  And guess what, still nobody made contact with me to resolve the issue - Almost a month later.  AMAZING the wonderful customer service we're use to.

95	/dstv-multichoice/reviews/account-2381689	Account Hi Multichoice,  I was a DSTV customer and cancelled my debit order. As this is a prepaid service as advertised by themselves DSTV took it upon themselves to charge me for services not paid by me upfront as they state how they work and not requested by myself, they even have an advert running if you don’t pay upfront your service will be suspended. They have now put Debt collectors on me to pay for service not requested by me and not paid upfront as they state how they work. I have not agreed with Multichoice to have 30 day account with them and it amazes me how they can charge you for services not requested and not paid upfront. They are very rude over the phone and keep on interrupting me when I want to state my case and have even cut me off when I requested to speak to someone in management. I have requested that they correct my account and take away the charges they have billed me for and that was never paid upfront by me as that is the service they are running.

98	/dstv-multichoice/reviews/account-a-total-mess-2431237	Account a total mess December was a fight just to get one device activated whilst on holiday, that's a complaint for another day. Month end comes no deduction. Follow up with SABC sorry DSTV and they confirm debit order is in place no worries. Then comes the 18th an amount of R 1580 is deducted on a pricelock of R 899.00 ??? Log onto Dstv my account is in credit with R 600.00 and debit date changed to 18th. Phone the SABC sorry DSTV call centre and they have no answers. So hence DSTV where did I give permission to deduct on the 18th of the month and why do you over deduct R 600. This is contract break on the Pricelock and a breach of my debit order authority mandate, seing you have t and c's on contract break. Lastly all my calls now totaling about 128 minutes according to my cellphone bill will this be credited to my account as well??????	0	0	0	1	0	1

My Explorer was struck by lightning and was in to be replaced. I bought an HD 4U and requested that my current package needs to be moved over to the HD 4U while I was waiting for the Explorer replacement. I was shocked when my wife told me that we suddenly have the Premium package which I never mentioned nor requested seeing that they only had to transfer my Current Extra package to the new decoder. I Phoned and told them I will not pay anything due to there mistake off giving me the wrong package. I went through my statement and I see they charge me for that Package. I'm sorry but this is completely unacceptable and this was mentioned as they take voice recording. I would like that money payback ALL of it not only for the few days seeing that it was completely your fault for something i never requested. Go through the recording and you'll hear that I did mention this. You'll clearly see a major mess up of my account on the 7 march 2016.

I have been phoned by there debt. Department and they won't stop no matter how many times I tell them I don't owe them anything, they even had the gall to say I agreed to pay them.

109	/dstv-multichoice/reviews/account-deduction-explanation-1973932	Account deduction explanation Gooday I recently took up the explora(which was delivered late and with no indication of who will install it) and the consultant who was selling it and reading the terms and conditions to me stated that i needed to pay R149 within 7days so that the explora can be delivered; he also stated that the R149 will be subtracted from the initial monthly premium of the explora. However they deducted more money. When i called in on Monday i was told that someone will call me back on the same day to explain the charges but yet i still have not received any calls from Multichoice instead they deducted the funds. I am very angry with this poor service ever since i took up the explora. Firstly it was delivered late and when it came, i couldn't even watch it as there was no indication of who will install it. After using my airtime to contact an installer Multichoice then deducts me more funds than that i agreed to and no one from their department has called me back to explain this as i was told someone will call me the monday already. 	0	0	1	0	0	1

I was told that this could only be via debit order payment and since I was already paying via debit order, this was not a problem to me. Ever since I accepted the Price Lock option, I've had my DStv services suspended 4 times because my account was suddenly in arrears even though my payments are via debit order. Every time my services got suspended I had to call the Call Center in an effort to resolve this. On each occasion I spoke to the Call Center agents, I was told that the matter was escalated to the relevant department to resolve. On the last occasion I spoke to the Supervisor by the name of Anthony (Pta offices) who advised that since the matter had been escalated already and because the matter had not been resolved, he'd personally go the relevant dept and phone me back to give me an update. I'm yet to hear from Anthony and the debit order went through and I was double billed. I even logged an online query on the DStv site which promised that this would be resolved within 3 days. Despite all my efforts, I was still incorrectly billed.  Can DStv resolve this mess created by them and stop making false promises to their clients and sort out their billing.	1	0	1	1	1	1

I am very annoyed as the lady I spoke to didn't even want to give me her email address, she was not interested in my query and asked me to send to proof of payments.

On the 27th December I got same message and I called once again, I explained my issue out of frustration this time the consultant told me the statement was not sent through to finance and the Bank Statement sent will not be sufficient as I need to send a transaction history I then told her I'd go to the bank as I've made it a recurring payment which does not show transaction history. She then reconnected me.  On 28th December I went to the bank they said the only proof I can give DSTV is the bank statement as it is a recurring payment and will not show transaction history at all, I then drove to drove to Multichoice in Randburg where I was assisted by Refilwe who was very friendly and tried to be helpful. I explained the whole story above and she went  to speak to someone from the finance department with my statement I had sent, they also said they want transaction history, did not bother to go an extra mile and follow up on the matter was simply told to go back to my bank and get what they want. I called Capitec whilst I was with the consultant and showed her the app and how it works of which both confirmed what I had said. Refilwe then said she would cancel the reconnections that took place and gave me an amount that I need to pay in R248.39 which would be payment for connection as of the 28th December until 30th January. She then said the R385.00 that I had paid on the 30th November as shown on the Bank statement will be sorted and I need not worry, mind you spent over an hour at multichoice. Later that day I received an sms stating I owe R459.51 despite following procedure and being told I will not be in errors after making payment I was requested to pay.  I'm really ANGRY, FRUSTRATED and DISAPPOINTED at the fact that Consultants I called did not escalate the matter as promised and  it seems like finance is not trying to assist in any way and follow up on the matter after I've made effort to bring proof of payment as requested, and to think I'm a loyal client who always and still pays on time without a doubt and I'm being treated like a bad client. In the processes I'm loosing my Time and Money by calling endlessly and driving far just to get the matter resolved, This is not FAIR! Still dealing with the issue to-date! Everytime I called and I stayed for over 30mins on the phone. I'm really disappointed in the level of service! Honestly if this matter is not resolved as much as I love DSTV I will cancel my subscription as I can not be treated as though I'm an unloyal customer. To make it worse NO ONE is helpful and now it seems like I'm in error of which I'm not but clearly no 1 cares.! I spoke to 2 different supervisor/managers Duncan and Siphamandla whom were telling me about protocol and not coming up with solutions to issue.  This is by far the worst experience I've faced with DSTV and even the complaints department haven't gotten back to me!   Regards Nomsa Nkomo	1	0	1	1	1	1

136	/dstv-multichoice/reviews/account-query-was-not-forthright-with-monies-owed-to-me-2346544	Account query - was not forthright with monies owed to me I have 2 subscriptions for 2 houses. On reactivating the one subscription I was charged additional amounts and rated the customer service as a 1 due to the: attitude of the call centre agent when asking what products there were. Together with this they suddenly wanted to hand me over to attorneys for non-payment when I have always for the past 15 years paid via debit order. I get a call from the customer care centre to ask why I scored them so low. I just got cover ups and no taking responsibility of what happened. Then I asked why I was charged extra he had a vague answer. I paid multiple charges for who knows what.  A week later I decide to cancel the other account as my tenant is moving out.  I just happen to ask in the conversation why I was charged R933 on activation and then again a week later for the re-activated subscription.  After asking 20 questions the agent gets defensive to then answer my questions that they have over-charged me. Oh so they need to refund me? Yes they need to refund me.  If I hadn't of asked 20 questions and gotten the agent on the defensive side I would have assumed all is well, but I wanted an answer as everything was so vague and the more I asked the more they talked into circles and then that is what they were trying to tell me.  Your agents are disgusting. They can't problem solve. They are bad at communication. they can't speak directly and honestly. They can't speak English. There is always a long story around several bushes and trees before an answer is given. The customer has to give the answer a couple of times before they say Yes that is it.  Incompetent agents. Bad customer service. Bad communication. DSTV would not have told me about the money they owed me else they would of taken it off the following month which they didn't, so they effectively stole from me.  And what is there to watch on DSTV anyway. Pull up your socks. You used to be a good company.	1	1	0	0	0	1

I was told that I have to pay an extra half month premium for a service I haven't used. I was told the standard terms and conditions story, was not treated as an individual. I am very unhappy.  Each time in the past, DSTV demanded their money no later than two days after payment due date, otherwise they cut your service and charge a reconnection fee. This time they decided to let my DSTV run for an extra 15 days. As a consumer who works overseas every few months, I did not see it necessary to cancel dstv, as they cut it anyway. I left for overseas on the 27th and they just continued to keep my dstv on to until the 12th of the following month in order to con me out of more money.  I spoke to a lady who says she's a manager at dstv, but seemed to be nothing more than a puppet repeating terms and conditions. Terrible service 	0	0	0	0	0	1
139	/dstv-multichoice/reviews/account-service-and-charges-disgrace-2374137	Account service and charges disgrace REF no from call center:  ********** 0i90 We have been for ever clients of Multichoice - and have been paying forever too much! I have had a issue with payment since 2011.  To my dissapointment dstv / multichoice is changing with every call centre staff member talking to me. Our account have been spilt in different addresse to different locations to my husbands name to my name... my point... In 2011 I paid RR7284 on account  ********** 5 2012 R7 ********** R8 **********  R 8 **********  R 11 **********  R2297.71 and in 2013 to account  ********** 0 R2 **********  R12760 and 2015 R8500  so in total I have paid 2013/2014/2015 an amount of R51600 rand - one family - holiday viewing and home viewing If multichoice did not switch decoders on and off they  kept changing accounts. So now I have 4 decoders on my name because they phased decoders out and change systems.  Not long ago we could travel with our smart card and put it in our holiday decoders.  that changed in time. This is not even me paying for movies that I rented on box office,  So I paid from my cheque account and every movie I ever rented went though on one of these accounts too.  I basically double paid for ever box office movie. That being said.... I am R800 in arrears.   I wanted to switch a holiday day card on - pay upfront, but I cant be helped because Multichoice never came back to me and they cant see back to my account. Lucky I kept the printouts multichoice gave me when I was in dispute.  And fortunately my bank can go back.... AND TO MY DISGRACE I WAS UNDER THE IMPRESSION MULTICHOICE DONE AWAY WITH THE PAY 11 MONTHS AND GET ONE MONTH FREE BECAUSE WE ARE ANNUAL CUSTOMERS..... so here I hear tonight for the staff member I should remind Multichoice I am an annual customer because they DO NOT CREATE annual customers. For ever we have been paying upfront every year - not receiving our discount.  Being told it does not apply!  We started paying monthly because we are so over billed.  We do not have a debit order because of this and Mulitchoice is still not being honest about the fact that we should only pay for 11 months and not 12!  THE ONLY REASON WE ARE USING MULTICHOICE IS BECAUSE MNET IS THE ONLY PEOPLE HAVING THE SPORT CHANNELS.    If it was not for the sport channels we would not use multichoice.   Your account system is pathetic and you have no clue.  You have never ever come back to us on our account.  I have been to multichoice service center and it has been pathetic.  I can not tell you how many times in Pretoria and Umhlanga.  It is one of those things you take the knock and move on.  But after tonights conversation I once again realized how pathetic Multichoice accounts really are.    I do hope another company would come in and get the sports rights.  Mulitchoice would be dumped so quick.  You do not deserve 1 star.   You are only in because you have sole rights for tv.  Pathetic that this is allowed.  Government should have sold you out long ago  Erika Kruger	1	0	1	1	0	1

I phoned into the call center and asked for it to be upgraded from 1st of December.  I paid the R295 on 30 November and as from 1 December I was on the Compact package. On 30 December I paid my R295 again but on 4 January I received a SMS that my account was R140 overdue (the R70 discount for December and R70 for January. I phoned the call center and the lady I spoke to said she new about the discount special and couldn't understand why I now had to pay the full amount. I asked her to put me back to the Family package to avoid future problems regarding this issue and she did. That means I actually paid R295 for the month and should have been refunded for only having the Family package which cost R235 but I didn't want to argue about R60. I paid the R235 on January 31 with an EFT as always and on 3 February my DSTV service was suspended. I phoned the call center again and was told that they haven't received any payment. I emailed the lady my proof of payment and was reconnected within 30 minutes. But on 8 February, my service was suspended again. Again I phoned the call center and the lady said she couldn't understand why it was suspended and reconnected it straight away. But then again this morning the 13th of February, I had to find it suspended again and I had to phone the call center again!!!!!! The guy said I was probably disconnected because I owe Multichoice R72.58, R22.58 for late payment with my payment only reflecting on 5 February and then R50 for the disconnection fee on 8 February. He reversed the disconnection fee but said he couldn't do anything about the late payment fee.  As far as I'm concerned, Multichoice owes me money for cheating me out of the special to upgrade to Compact and me having to cancel the upgrade at the 4th of January but still paid for it till the end of January.  Now they keep disconnecting my service because according to them I made a late payment but I have proof that I have paid 1 day before the due date!!!!!! But to try prevent more of these extremely annoying disconnections which I know is not my fault but their incompetence, I will pay the R22.58 right now. They know they have a monopoly but for our kids sake, we have no choice but to just accept their incompetent service.	0	0	0	1	1	1

149	/dstv-multichoice/reviews/account-suspended-48-2004569	Account Suspended August last year I've decided to get my account back up and running, now I pay manually every month and since September last year I got suspended. When I phoned they said I've paid my money into the box office account, the consultant was nice enough to transfer the money to the right account after I paid the R50 reconnection fees.... Next month the same thing happened and was confused as the consultant gave me the account details I must use as a reference, but ok.... The next couple of months I've tried every way off payment but the same thing happens and it goes to my box office. Last month I phoned and got angry with the innocent employee and he agreed that there must be a problem somewhere and he will get it sorted.... So again March comes and yes the account got suspended so I phoned again and the guy said yes it's all sorted now but I still owe R805 after I asked where my refund was for the last 6 months of reconnection fees... He said it was already calculated in the amount...... Now I don't know but it should of been around 400 to 500 so I guess it's not really sorted and the guy just wanted me of the phone.

150	/dstv-multichoice/reviews/account-suspended-because-i-wanted-to-see-the-tcs-2337293	Account suspended because I wanted to see the T&Cs Yesterday, a guy called me from DStv to offer me a new Explora decoder on the 2 year price lock plan. Our conversation went something like this: Me: Thanks, but there is nothing wrong with our current decoder, so I don't need that.  Him: Don't you need extra view? Me: There are only 2 people who can operate a TV living in our house, so that's not necessary either. Thanks. Him: You can have the price lock plan without a decoder? You can lock your subscription fee at last year's price for 2 years.  Me: I don't want to get locked into a contract because I'm not sure I'll keep my DStv once we get fibre in our area.  Him: You won't be locked in, you can cancel at any time, but there will be a cancellation fee of R189. Me: Ok, well that's not too bad, can you send me the T&Cs via email so I can go through them and make sure I'm 100% comfortable with everything before signing on? Him: Once you agree to the price lock plan, the T&Cs will be sent to you within 24-48 hours. Me: No, but I want to see them BEFORE I agree. Him: No, you must agree now before I can send them to you. Me: So, you want me to agree to something before I understand what I'm signing up for? If that's the case, there really is no point continuing this conversation. Him: Ok, thanks for your time. [end of call]  A short while later my wife called me to say our DStv had gone wonky – we only had channel 100 and all the other channels just gave an error. I asked if she'd tried switching it off and on again, which she had. We left it and went to my folks for dinner but when I checked it this morning, I saw DStv has suspended my account, seemingly because I didn't want to sign up for their promo without first seeing the T&Cs. There's no other logical reason. My account is fully paid up, I've NEVER missed a debit order and it was working prior to the phone call...

So I was a few days late, according to Law, you have a Grace Period till the 4th of the next month, to make a payment.  After phoning the Call Center on Saturday, and fighting with them as they cannot just Suspend your Service because of the Grace Period, they were lenient enough to Reconnect us, without charging us a Re-connection Fee.  But to our disgrace this morning, our DSTv is Suspended again, demanding a Re-connection Fee of R108.90, and they have Record of Payment received on the 30th of Jan.  This is outrageous, I have been through this before with you on Saturday, you can't Suspend my Service for being late with payment, when there is a Grace Period.  And how can you  re-connect me, and all of a sudden, just suspend me again.  You are being unlawful and I feel like cancelling the DSTv Service, as you are messing us around.  Like I said, you can't suspend my Service for late payment, there is ACCORDING TO LAW, a grace Period till the 4th of every new month.

Ive Upgraded to the Premium pakage in December (9th) while the Christmas special of R600 for December and January was running.  December 27th I was billed R345 for the compact service on the 8th January a reversal of only R222.58 was done. On the 12 January R759 minus (R160) was added to my account. Ive been phoning the DSTV call centre numouros times and explained this and then be assured they see the problem and that this will be corrected. I phoned I dont know how many times. I went in to the multi choice office in Worcester 3 times as well. I even put this on facebook. Last month I was promised that a supervisor will call me but that also never happend. If they can give me a reason why they keep this diffrence on my account I would appreciate it. I want to connect my other DSTV but if they cant even sort out or at least give a valid reason why this cant be sorted. This is frustrating as I have phoned and drove out more than the outstanding ammount. Please if you value your customers you would at least tell me what the reason is.	1	0	1	1	0	1
156	/dstv-multichoice/reviews/accounting-idiots-at-dstv-1954312	Accounting Idiots at DSTV Since I moved over to the new Explora Payment Plan every month is a tiresome fight to correct my account. After paying with EFT's for more than 20 years without a hassle I was forced to move to Debit Orders. That was when all the crap started. It has taken me almost a year to get them to transfer a credit balance from my old account to the new account. Although the Debit Order Amount is R849 per month last year they only debited R475, leaving my account in arrears by R374. The exact amount that my old account is in credit with. Meanwhile to add the cherry on the cake DSTV reported me every month as being in arrears with the credit bureaus. Last month the credit amount was finally transferred to my new account. Hallelujah!! Imagine my surprise when this month the Debit Order was for R475 again and my account shows an amount of R374 in arrears that will be reported to the Credit Bureaus.

The service agent indicated that she had set the system to send the statements by email and could not explain why they were not being sent. I have been disconnected for not paying on time. The self service site indicates that I only owe an amount by the 2nd of March 2019. To get reconnected I need to pay a re-connection fee. I will not be paying any re-connection fee and I will finally be rid of this truly abysmal service and the associated incompetence.	1	0	0	0	1	0

Since I have taken out this package there were always a problem with my account showing that it is in arrears. After multiple emails sent to the accounts department with no replies, and numerous telephone conversations with the client departments they still can not resolve my account. Every month they disconnect my services, only stating that my account is in arrears. After making cash payments on this account they only tell me that I am behind on the price lock account. I have shifted money over into that account to bring it up to date but the problem don`t get solved. I have downloaded my last statement of July 2017 and it does not show any arrears.

165	/dstv-multichoice/reviews/accounts-disaster-unauthorised-incorrect-debit-order-2636975	Accounts Disaster & Unauthorised Incorrect Debit order! About 5 months ago I moved from a regular package to a price lock package.  Ever since then I have had endless drama with my account.  They created two accounts somehow and now whenever I make payment into my DSTV account at Checkers it goes into the old dormant account.  Thereby reflecting that my new account is now sitting in arrears of R3771.00.  Almost weekly my  DSTV gets disconnected and I have to phone the call centre, speak to a new agent, and explain the situation.  Every single one of the agents says that they are going to fix the issue, but of course nothing gets done.   What am I to do??  Now I have DSTV doing UNAUTHORISED debit orders of R1800 on my account.  I thought it was fraudulent as I phoned Multichoice and the call centre agent assured me that I was a cash customer and NO debit order had been done on my account.  Only to phone back two days later to be told that, yes they did try debit my account and I need to pay the R1800 to get my account back out of arrears.  I asked them how on earth I would run up an arrears of R1800 if my account is disconnected if I pay R40 short???  That would be two full months of having DSTV without paying a cent..  Which I have not done.  My account is paid in full every single month at Checkers, and they have now misplaced my funds.  So they just go ahead and debit my account to rectify their mistake.  Multichoice you wonder why you are losing so much business in SA, and why people are turning to Netflix and streaming movies.  Dealing with you is honestly not worth the aggravation for what we pay!!!	1	0	0	0	1	1

Multichoice charges a reconnection fee every time but they cannot sort out the problem. Every time I phone they tell me that their Finance Department must allocate the payment but they don't do it. How can it take almost four months to sort out this problem. It is also not possible to phone their Finance Department. Proof of payment was also sent to Multichoice several times.

On 8 November 2017 we made a R1000.00 payment Toward the Account as the Account was Suspended, Account was reconnected as the Call centre agent said that we should call on the 10th to make an arrangement. on the 10th of November my account was suspended again, I called in and made an arrangement for end of November, I asked the guy will my account only be suspended when payment is not made. he advised me yes that is so, on the 14th my account was suspended again I called in again account was reconnected and arrangement was made AGAIN. So yes everything Sorted, Guess What 16 November 2017 Account is Suspended AGAIN. Furious I phoned DSTV they advised that they will reconnect and capture the payment again and Finance will call me just to verify my arrangement, No one called me, today on the 20th November 2017 Account get SUSPENDED AGAIN 5th time in 12 days. they capture arrangement and say finance will contact me with a proposition on arrangement. Up until 09:20 no call has been made and I am sure that on the 22th of November account will be suspended again, please can I have clarification on this. and everytime account is reconnected a reconnection fee of R80.00 is added to my account. so most of the arrears is reconnection fees.	1	0	1	1	1	0

As I did not have insurance on my decoder and it was struck by lightning, I was forced to buy a new decoder.  Sales people sold me a DSTV Explora, this apparently was the best thing ever.  To my disappointment I am still struggling after three days to get it up and running.  After numerous calls to the call centre and a trip to the nearest Service Provider Office at Princess Crossing, I am still struggling.  I was promised that they will activate it and call me in an hour.  Several hours have passed and I am still waiting for a phone call.  I have decided to phone the call centre again, and guess what they can still not help me.  My excitement for the Explora was short lived as I am still struggling to get it to work.  As a customer I am very disappointed.  The consultant at the call centre took all my details again and as he was not able to help me he book a fault at the Technical department who will be phoning me within 24 hours.  I now realise that at this moment I cannot get more disappointed at the service provided.  My question is if you were the customer would you be satisfied with this service.  	0	0	1	1	0	0

I subscribed for Pricelock in April of 2018 and was advised by the agent that installation was included in the subscription amount of R959. I got a call a few weeks later from the company that done the installation at my home advising me that they have not been paid for their services which amounted to R1335. I advised the lady from the installation company that I had chosen the Pricelock plan which included installation and that dstv should have settled their bill. She then contacted multichoice, I'm not too sure what they discussed but when I made contact with her again she advised me that everything had been sorted out. I have now discovered that an extra amount of R89 has been added to my monthly subscription for the installation fees! And I now have to pay a total of R1048 (R959 + R89).  This is DISGUSTING service! How can my monthly bill be increased without my consent or knowledge?  I felt like I could trust dstv and multichoice but instead I feel completely manipulated. I have logged a query which has hopefully been sent to the finance department and which will hopefully get resolved, but I won't hold my breath! I will continue calling the contact center to get this sorted out even though it is a total waste of my airtime and time!

But to them it doesn't now I must pay 165 for sweet nothing. Then I get told no I must pay 165 coz I pay my account late. Yet if I pay late then y didn't they cut my service. They need to send their agents for service I can't be told it's because of my personal functions and cables and then turn around and say it's cause I pay my account late. So they don't know what they doing or what they billing us for. We watch so much repeats it's not even funny but we pay so much. When they put new programmes without repeating so much.

178	/dstv-multichoice/reviews/additional-billing-for-re-connection-fee-2354293	ADDITIONAL BILLING FOR RE CONNECTION FEE Good day   I am deeply aggravated by my communications with the DSTV call centre over the last few month.  Ever since I reconnected my DSTV in December 2016 – I have endless problems.  I make payment every month before the 1st, using the pay and clear function on FNB. Noting that I pay an extra levy just to ensure that my DSTV account is paid by the 1st.  The events of late have left me with the reasoning that the DSTV accounts department either do not know what they are doing, or DSTV are trying to rob clients of their hard earn money. I have previously called in, begged for my calls to escalated and to no avail I get no joy.  Every month before I make payment I call DSTV to confirm that I need to pay R365 (compact subscription) – every month there is an additional reconnection charge. Why should I as the customer pay a reconnection charge if my account is paid on time.  Below are the answers and explanations I have been getting from your call centre.   1. In July I called, I was given the amount of 329.12 – due to the fact that I had over paid. I make the payment as told to me, the next day I get a message that I must pay another R90 – no one can give me any answers. Eventually the messages stop coming but my DSTV gets disconnected on a SUNDAY – I call the call centre, then my DSTV is reconnected.   2. In August, again I call the call centre get an amount of 365.00 – I make the payment. 20 minutes later I get an SMS to say I owe 415 – now I ask you what kind of system changes the amounts within minutes. I call the call centre back. The lady is screaming at me, I tell her I want her to listen to the previous call I made because it will show that I was told to pay 365.00. her answer to me was that the system adds the R50 reconnection fee INCASE the payment is not made on time. Now I have been working in finance for 17 years, not in my life have I heard such bull****.  3. In September (being today 28/09/2017) as you can see I am paying for October – naturally my instalment should be R365 – SEEING AS I PAID ON TIME THE PREVIOUS MONTH. NO – apparently I have to pay R415 because I short paid last month. She also mentioned that she cannot answer as to why my payment was no allocated according to the date I made the payment. I have proof that I have used the “pay and clear immediately function” so I would like proof that my payment was not received in your bank on the date that I made the payment.   I have paid the payment of R365.00 because as per the attached I have paid before the 1st of every month and I will not pay a reconnection fee when I have never been late with a payment.   I would like urgent feedback on this compliant – I believe that DSTV is taking advantage of me as customer and being completely disrespectful to me as a paying customer.	1	1	0	1	0	0

Why do you get them then and why does it say to get the outstanding amount sms your id to the following number? uhmmm I don't know but sorry mam I can't reconnect your services if you do not pay that in.    WTF ????     If you get an account statement that should be the amount that you are suppose to pay or am I just stupid????? I swear I'm going to start a campaign against multichoice and contact overseas companies to see if they will invest in a different service provider in South Africa, going to show the hellopeter.com and wherever else I get complaints about multichoice and show them how much money they will make here if they do do that!!!!!  	1	0	0	0	1	0
193	/dstv-multichoice/reviews/all-new-level-of-incompetency-1973545	All new level of incompetency ! How many people do I still need to speak to to fix this total and utter monumental blunder that has become such a huge irritation in my life !    I no longer have 2 decoders at 2 different addresses, this has been the case for at least 4 months but every month I get informed that my services will be suspended unless payment is made even though you deduct your debit order from my account every single month.  Every month my service get suspended I have to call you and sort it out at my expense and these calls are never shorter than 20 min.    I have spoken to numerous people over the last 4 months and every time before hanging up I get promised that everything is sorted out. Well until today this is still a problem, I just don't understand how something so simple cannot be resolved by a company claiming to be so innovative.   What is Multichoice going to do to fix this immediately ?  I also demand to be compensated for all the unnecessary time, money and despair I have experienced so far  by all your incompetent staff including team leaders. 	1	1	0	1	1	0

196	/dstv-multichoice/reviews/all-talk-no-action-nothing-gets-done-1-2196699	All talk, no action...nothing gets done I think this is about my 5th complaint on here, and I will just carry on until it is resloved.Â I got a call last week from another one of your staff, that was slightly competent sounding, and thought that we had now resolved this situation (not to my satisfaction, but just to make the hack of dealing with you aside) She agreed and admitted that the issue with you not debitting my account was because of a new system you implemented and had issues with, so once again, not my mistake, not my error but I am the one that ends up suffering the consequenses. After admitting it was DSTVs fault and I insisted on DSTV taking some accountability for the mistake, she agreed to write off 2 months (R1598), which i decided to just accept as I know I won't get anything better from a company that doesn't take ownership of it's mistakes and system errors and couldn't care less about their clients that suffer as a consequence there off. Your clients are, at the end of the day, just account numbers that pay you religously for sub par TV.I requested an email gets send to me confirming the proposal that was made, which was agreed...but a week later is still to be sent. I also asked that the debit order that was in force for over 6 years please be reinstated, which was also agreed....and here is 1 February 2017 and no debit order again.Â  I am at my wits end with DSTV andÂ your incompetence at all levels. I am not going to run around trying to pay you cash for the services that you are suppose to debit from my account. I also requested that the arrears days on my Transunion credit report be removed, which was also agreed and is still firmly sitting there.I regret taking your fixed plan for your Explora decoder at R799 per month as I feel it would be way easier to close by DSTV account if I didn't. I will happily go without DSTV, pay you the balance owing on your decoder and we can call it quits and I will stick to my internet based TV viewing. I give this to you as a proposal, so we can gt out of eachother's hair forever.Please please please do not let someone new call again for the 5th time that has no idea what is going on here.	1	0	0	1	0	0

After a couple of days, I received a message of my account being overdue. I then called the Call Centre, and was requested to email proof of payment to the proof of payment email address. This was all done on the 19th of Jan.   In short, the payment has still not been allocated by the Accounts department after several escalations with them. My service on the other hand keeps on being disconnected, and everytime when that happens I must call and request to be reconnected. My service has been disconnected 3 times already in a space of two weeks. No attention is given to the problem as I am told that it takes 24hours for a payment to be allocated. Clearly mine is taking longer.  The service being provided is unsatisfactory, you cant even get through the Accounts department.	0	0	0	1	1	0

I have been asked to forward my proof of payment 4 times already and they don't even bother to call me back or email me back to explain what's the hold up or the action that they have taken. I even specified that can at least notify me once they have received my mail and if the issue is sorted still nothing and my service is disconnected. I am really disappointed at the level of unprofessionalism for such a big company. They don't even issue you with a reference number so that you can track how far your issue is; you have to start all over again with a new consultant who will do exactly like the other ones.

201	/dstv-multichoice/reviews/allocation-of-payment-services-disconnected-2353022	Allocation of payment - services disconnected I made a payment into my account in August 2017, this payment was not allocated (not sure why as i used the same account no. and reference that i use every month). My services were disconnected due to account being in arrears. I called DSTV and was asked to email the proof of payment which i did and the services were connected again. I was then told the matter would be escalated to the accounts department so that they can allocate the payment.  My services kept on being disconnected about twice every week and each time i have to call, the call centre agent can see the proof of payment on the ssystem he connects again and tells me he will escalate. On the 5th or 6th call, the call centre agent asks me for a case number, i tell him no one has ever given me a case number to which he says if the matter was really escalated i should have received a case number. Now i wonder what the other call centre agents have been doing????? He sends me a case number via email, then a few days later follows up with the accounts department and still nothing. No reponse from anyone and my services still get disconnected every couple of days.  I am so frustrated because the scheduled payment for this month has also gone through today and it reflected immediately on my account with no change in reference no. or account details. SO WHAT HAPPENED TO MY AUGUST PAYMENT???? No one seems to be able to assist, the call centre agents wont transfer me to a manager or someone more senior to assist me, they just keep telling me my matter has been escalated.  How can such a big company not be able to allocate a payment for a whole month when you have the payment date, account number and refernce number used. I am so shocked by the incompetence. So quick to disconnect my services but can't allocate a simple payment.  A WHOLE MONTH later and there is no solution. Not to mention the airtime that i have spent to call each time and hold on the line while they look for the proof of payment, or a system that wont connect, or trying to allocate the payment themselves.	0	0	0	1	1	0

Incompetent personal contacted me and when I phoned 2. Only got escalated, they were not competent to fix it, even asked for the competency, non received 3. Incorrect billing = Costs to my pocket 4. At least an R 1000 airtime wasted calling multichoice 5. Empty bullsh*t promises from multichoice 6. My phone recorded all the conversations I had with them = Key learning, install call recorder, helped me a lot to prove multichoice wrong 7. Took me 6 months trying to settle my explora decoder = key learning, don't take an decoder at multichoice on an monthly sum, if you read the complaints on here, most of the is about explora 8. Account still not correct, I have proved that I'm correct on my side, but multichoice says different, but they can't prove it 9. Reply on this site and emails looks like an automated response, they reply and apologise, but do nothing  Only solution I learn through my year battle with multichoice, is to get NETFLIX or AMAZON, it is cheaper and the service is friendly, I wish everyone struggling with dstv to get it  Greetings  	1	0	0	1	0	0

He proceeded to advise that He would come that Day, however, could not advise on the time frame.  The rest of the week passed and the installer did not call again.  It is now the 28th and still our Explora has not been installed. No feedback no Nothing yet I receive a message asking to rate the Service Received?! Wow Multichoice!.

I have my 04Jan 2019 statement clearly stating I had an opening balance of - 1062.00 due to over payment. Outstanding balance reads R427.00.  My dstv was cut which I phoned and canceled my explora and pvr subscription and told them I only want the compact plus decoder connected. I was told no problem I must pay R429 within 24 hrs and she reconnected for me. I made that payment next morning.   Low and behold the compact plus has been disconnected once again. I phone and get into a huge argument with AN EXTREMELY UNHELPFUL GENTLEMAN,  arguing the R429. 00 is os from November. Your statement clearly states period 30 Nov  to 29 December.  Opening balance minus R1062.93. Closing balance R429.57.  Now I must pay over R800 to have my services reconnected without being giving an explanation what that is for. You staff are completely incompetent.  This is not the 1st time, last time I had to drive to Randburg where I was proven to be correct and had to be re embursed.

205	/dstv-multichoice/reviews/always-offline-wrong-info-given-and-still-without-dstv-2419199	ALWAYS offline, wrong info given AND still without DSTV Good day.  Me and my husband decided to get the DSTV price lock plan at the beginning of this week. Being a mom of 2 small children, under 2years of age, I went to the DSTV/multichoice branch in Witbank where we currently reside. The consultant explained to me that I need to either send a sms or apply over the internet. Which I was completely satisfied with, as long as I can do things from home and not having to take my children from  their routines, I'm happy. Plus, my daughter suffers from a kidney problem and thus is immunocompromised, so I try my best to keep her away from big crowds of people.  After applying over the internet, I emailed the needed documentation to DSTV. Upon checking the process, I saw that there is one document outstanding. Confirmation of bank account holder. I phoned the branch and a document was sent to me to fill in. I emailed it back and for about 4 hours there was no change in the process, it still showed that the Confirmation of bank account holder is outstanding. I phoned the branch again, the lady explained that i have to bring the document in personally. I left my house with both my children for the second time that day. Upon arriving at the Branch the lady informed me that the system is offline and she cannot help me, I gave her the form I filled in and se explained to me that this is not the correct form.. Disappointed, I left the branch, thinking I'l manage the following day when the system in back online again.  The second day, which is Thursday, I phoned the Branch early to ask them exactly what document I need for the Confirmation of Bank accountholder. The lady verbalised that i need to come in to the store because se cannot explain this document over the phone. Do once again, I took both my children and left my home to go to the store as requested by the lady over the phone. And again upon arriving at the branch, the system  was offline. And again I could not be helped. She explained that she needs to check online for my confirmation of accountholder document. I left the branch unhappy for a fourth time, as I cannot wait at the store for them to come back online.  Once I arrived home I phoned the branch, they were still offline. I phoned them again at 14:34, and yes you guessed it, STILL OFFLINE.  I am soooo unhappy with this.	0	0	0	1	0	0

211	/dstv-multichoice/reviews/and-dstv-continue-to-disappoint-2352780	And DSTV Continue to Disappoint I have been having endless problems with your accounts and call centre department for the past 4 months. When calling in on the 25th May to obtain the full amount outstanding that I needed to pay in to square up my account I was advised that the total was R1948, which I then paid in no problem – thinking my account was all in order. To my surprise the next month an amount of over R2000 was deducted and then this whole back and forth started..  Your call centre agents give me half information and are of no help at all and when I said I would escalate I was told they are going to escalate to the Price Lock team but this doesn’t get done and the debt amount just gets a higher.  I’ve been waiting for almost a month for someone from the price lock team to contact me but only when I post updates on face book for everyone to see does someone respond but still NO RESOLUTION. An agent called last week and I requested that someone call to help me arrange a payment plan – NOTHING then I spoke to another agent yesterday and I am still waiting for someone to call back. Yes I know my account is in arrears and I would like to catch up on that amount but you guys don’t give me an opportunity as you keep debiting the incorrect amount and no one ever contacts me back to make this arrangement. And by doing so the debit order does not go through and I end up with bank charges.. I do not want my account debited anymore as multichoice does not respect me or my account. Maybe it would be fair if Carte Blanche did some investigating on their own accounts department and see if all clients are happy with the way they are being debited. And the amount of respect their call centre agents have towards their  clients.. I know of more than 15 clients who are experiencing the same  debit order issues with DSTV.	1	1	1	1	0	0

217	/dstv-multichoice/reviews/angry-2642726	ANGRY Background of my story • 31st October 2018( Wednesday) Received a call from insurance company and I told them to call me end of November  • 4th December 2018(Sunday) My Explora decoders  didn’t want to play  • Took it to Isitya Satellite installation in Khayelitsha & I was told I need to buy a new one bcz my Explora is faulty and it can’t be repaired. • Purchased a second Hand Explora decoder for R600.00 on Sunday the 4th , because I couldn’t let my son not to watch his cartoons   Reasons why I’m writing or requesting the managers/directors of Multichoice to contact me  • If the insurance company didn’t call me 4 days before I was not going to write this message • I was told that my warranty expired in 2017 already, but no-one called me before to offer me this insurance • Why I wasn’t called before my warranty expired? • What makes me so mad is the fact that this happen just 4 days later  • I’m paying over R400 AND I REALLY DON’T THINK THAT I WAS GOING TO HAVE A PROBLEM IN PAYING JUST OVER R50.00 TO INSURE BOTH OF MY DECODERS • I have been loyal client/customer of Multichoice for over 8yrs and I’m on debit order NOT EVEN ONCE IT BOUNCED BACK  ? What I want   is my money that I used to purchase the second hand decoder as it was not my fault that the insurance company decided to call me almost two years later.  ? And I had no contact number or no number (Insurance) was given to me when I purchased this November 2016.  Please don’t refer me to your call centre I’m sick and tired of speaking to them as no one between Multichoice and the insurance company (The 3rd Party) does not want to take responsibility as your call centre kept on reminding me that they are not obliged to call all customers informing them about the warranty and to adviced them about insurance.  My question to the last guy that I spoke was. Whose responsibility is it to inform or offer insurance to its customers? And I was directed to DSTV Website and I told him that I don’t have access to internet, it only when I’m at work and it is very limited.  I received bad service from your call centre, is it because I’m a black female?	0	1	0	0	0	0
218	/dstv-multichoice/reviews/angry-2768048	ANGRY! In February DSTV sent an email indicating that if I pay 3months on time then the 4th month will be free. Around the week of the 20th I called DSTV to inform them that I will not be paying due to having qualified for this promotion. On the 25th my services were suspended I called in and they reconnected my services. To date my services have been disconnected about 4-5 times. This is getting irritating because I constantly have to spend a lot of airtime to call in, explain the story over and over again before my services are reconnected. I paid on time for 3months so why is that when I am supposed to get my 4th month I must struggle like this???	0	0	0	1	1	0
219	/dstv-multichoice/reviews/angry-and-robbed-customer-2589883	Angry and robbed Customer I applied and got the Compact price lock deal. According to the deal and contract I am to pay R549 pm. I got this deal month end of June. Month end of July when they debited the money they debuted +-R973 instead of the initially agreed amount. I called to enquirer and they said the extra money was for my showmax subscription plus the prorata. Which they didn’t really clarify but they mentioned it was a once off fee, when I asked why I was not told about this when I was applying they agent said it’s the mistake of whichever agent that was assisting me. Month end of August they debut about R1080 rands I enquirer and was advised to reverse the transaction and only pay the amount I had to pay which I did. This month they debited R1080 again. When I called them they explain a lot of stories about how I have two account and stuff. They even go as far as requesting my bank statements to verify the debit orders that am telling them about, yet he confirms that he sees the debit order on the system  In short can they refund me the difference when you remove the deal amount plus the bank fees I used to reverse the transaction plus for the fanatical strain they put me through with this whole thing! I missed a debit order because they took money they weren’t supposed to take.	1	0	0	0	0	1

225	/dstv-multichoice/reviews/annoyed-2749409	Annoyed  I am utterly annoyed with MultiChoice. I have recently upgraded from my HD decoder to the Explora. However the lack of proper communication is what bothers me most. Last week I had a problem with the decoder bring stopped due to some amount that I had to pay which I could not understand so called them to find out. The consulted that I spoke to was very sufficient and sorted it out hence I had two HD decoders so there some sort of a confusion. Now today I gave the same problem and when I phoned I got told a different story with same excuse with it being a confusions but was told today that I have to pay the R374 to activate my account. Firstly when installation was done there no communication about an access fee to be paid. My understanding was that I start paying an extra R139 as in from June on what I am paying and that there would be no any other charges except for the PVR benefits. Now I have to pay R374 for a miscommunication error. All I asked if the amount could be added to my account when I pay my monthly DSTV account and I was told no because it's prepaid which they didn't even consider the fact there was no communication. Well done MultiChoice for . Really annoyed with the lack of interest. To Lerato thank you for explaining everything in a professional manner to me today. They should train all the other employees properly when it comes to the terms and conditions and not just be in rush to make a quick sale. 	0	0	0	0	0	1

Multichoice is very big company to associate themselves with immature low standard courier companies to service their clients ,am so ****ed and annoyed the way Multichoice is treating their client,Is it because you guys don't have competitors in the market ?I have called your call center no one can assist saying that they don't have details of the courier company, am taking this complain to the media am sure am not the first and the last person to complain about the way you treat your clients.	0	0	0	1	0	0
227	/dstv-multichoice/reviews/annoyed-customer-2415693	Annoyed customer Good day  This morning when I woke up I was very annoyed when I saw the following message on my phone: FNB :-)Transaction failed. R6289.00 unsuccessful payment to cheq a/c..153407.Ref.Unpaid. 28Dec 06:32.  First of all I have spoken to customer care on multiple occasions, I have complained on hello Peter also more than once but the message doesn’t seem to be delivered as my account just seems to get more each month.  I am only going to try this one more time if it is not fixed by the end of next week I will take this matter futher as I am sick and tired of paying the cost on my bank account because this has not been sorted out.  My subscription has been suspended since June/July I have not switched it back on as I was irritated every month with my bill being more than what was agrees apon the fist month they deducted the correct amount after that my bill just started climbing I phoned and they told me ot would be sorted out and still nothing happend I phoned again after my bill was high at the end of the month and told them that I will not pay another cent until it is sorted out still haven’t heard anything and my account still suspended after a month or two I was fed up and decided to post a review on hello peter they phoned and said they will put me on a price plan for the outstanding amount plus my monthly amount, I was shocked how can tou expect me to pay if my dstv account was suspended this is unacceptable and will not be held liable to pay an amount to a service provider that has given no service.  Please get this correctly I DO NOT WANT DSTV ANYMORE. CORRECT THE ACCOUNT IMMEDIATELY BY CLOSING IT AND MAKING SURE THAT MY ACCOUNT REFLECTS R0 BY THE END OF NEXT WEEk.  This is the last time I try to talk to Multichoice in a nice way sort it out!	1	0	1	0	1	1
228	/dstv-multichoice/reviews/annoyed-customer-2482473	Annoyed customer I have bought an explora price lock for R119 in February with installation. I struggled for more than a week to get a dstv installer to come install my explora... finally they came and install on the 28 February and dstv said i must call them once it has been installed so that it can be activated, i then called on the 28th to tell them know.  Today when i wake up they have disconnected my services because they said that i didnt pay the R119 for February.... My question to them is how do i pay for something that hasn't been installed? I dont understand why i must pay R119 for the month of February but i didnt use the decoder at all in the month of Feb.  Please assist because am tired to call multichoice every week about this.

229	/dstv-multichoice/reviews/annoyed-dstv-client-2664478	Annoyed DSTV client On the 30/04/2017 I bought a DSTV HD decoder. Suddenly in December 2018, 9months later I am sitting with signal problems.  Two weeks without DSTV I went to the branch in N1 city Cape Town. I was told that my device was faulty and that I need a new one. Keep in mind I already paid for January 2019. I was told that they are out of stock and that they will call me when they receive stock. Until this day I am still waiting.  I asked what can be the cause of me not getting signal? I was told that it is a normal electronic fault. Never in my life I had a problem with any electronic thing I bought. Never experience such ****ty service before. Rather stick with the older decoders as the quality is better.	0	0	0	1	0	0

233	/dstv-multichoice/reviews/annual-subscriber-unaccounted-unauthorised-monthly-debit-deductions-2774870	ANNUAL SUBSCRIBER - UNACCOUNTED, UNAUTHORISED MONTHLY DEBIT DEDUCTIONS MultiChoice has been making unauthorised deductions on my account without discussion or clarification of what these deductions are for, especially being an Annual Subscriber that pays every 27th January every year.    I’ve made numerous calls since March 27th when these unauthorised deductions started and each time I get promises of someone will call to resolve this and nothing happens.  It is now more than three months and nothing is happening but monthly there is an unauthorised deduction that no one even bothers to explain, stop or reverse.  Which left me with no option but to request my bank to reverse these transactions.  Dstv does not even realise that I use airtime to make calls, I’ve had to pay the bank to STOP these deductions except that, each time they make this deduction, they change the reference number which makes my stopped debit directive to be ineffective.  Three months of making calls complaining about one and the same thing and nothing changes.  I’m the one that is troubled and it is left to me to find and make means for a resolution which Dstv created.  When I call Dstv call centre and add my details for verification, the system informs that my account is due for payment of R4 567.00 which is due 27th June 2019.  This does not make sense as, my next payment is due 27th January 2020.  My other concern is that, based on that statement on your call centre telephone system, my Dstv could be suspended yet I have paid till next year 26th January 2020.  I need someone to please, check on my account, fix whatever that requires fixing to resolve this problem.  Whatever you do, may I please not be inconvenienced as a result of someone having messed up Dstv system in my account, deal with that individual and let my account work as has been the case for all these years.  I am happy with my account date being 27th January and do not want it changed for any reason.  For that reason, my account should stay as is.  Through it all, it is totally unfair for me to be compromised, especially having been a Dstv client for more than 20 years.  If this is how clients are treated, honestly, something is totally wrong, Dstv needs to check their systems and the effectiveness of their so called call centres. They also have their own systems in place as each time one calls, it is said that these calls are recorded, if these work, then it will make it easy for them to use own systems to verify and correct challenges encountered by themselves as well as their clients.  An urgent response and action is awaited, hopefully before 27th June which as their system points out, my account is due then and I might just find myself out of service due to someone else’s doing and not my own even though I’ve paid and I am in advance. 	1	0	1	1	0	1

236	/dstv-multichoice/reviews/any-change-to-anything-leads-to-disaster-1959457	ANY change to anything leads to disaster Why is it that when you ask for a change, ANY CHANGE, Multichoice will get it wrong.  I  do not live in Jhb, and don't have DSTV there.  I have a spare decoder and decided to have an installer connect it to my tv so I could get dstv when not at home.  I wanted to test it, so I spoke to the call centre to have it connected on a \holiday\ basis where I would pay for the period I used it.  I had to leave Jhb suddenly the next day (28 January 2016) and could not get anyone to disconnect the \holiday\ service as the computers were down.  I called a number of times that day and they remained down, so in desperation I wrote an email at 20h55 asking them to suspend the service on that one decoder and I even quoted the smartcard number.  The idiot who got the email suspended my entire service, HD PVR and the old one which made up my dual view package as well as the \holiday connection\.  I called DSTV on Friday, Saturday and Sunday and it is only today that it was finally fixed completely.  I have had to spend hours on my cell phone and finally on my landline.  Anything takes ages to sort out and the poor customer is left with a huge cell phone bill to pay.  Multichoice sucks big time.	0	0	0	1	1	0

We finally reached an agreement where we bought a new dish and were promised free installation the next day,the day is almost over and we have recieved no calls,texts or emails from these people,when we called the stand earlier we were told that they would be unable to help us because they dont know where the installers are at that moment and calling them was not even an option.

238	/dstv-multichoice/reviews/appaling-customer-service-2556369	Appaling Customer service Im very disgusted at the level of service I received from Multi choice cape town I spoke to Thabang letabani this morning regarding my account I explained to him that my husband and  had a miss understanding I was under the impression he paid and he thought I paid. Last night logged onto my DSTV  Now app cause it was late at night and adv them that I will settle the account tomorrow I also cause her if I can change my DD date to the first of every month as I get paid the  31 /  30 of every month.  She Fundeka just cut me off not saying if she did change it or not and also asked her the balance including the disconnection fee as I thought its disconnected already as we don’t often watch TV   I then called up today to find out the balance and charges for setting up again.  I find out that its almost R1000 to reconnect again then I get fobbed off and spoke to like im some kind of piece of Dirt to a point where I had to tell this guy don’t speak to me like this im a customer im paying for a service. All he kept saying was you changed your DD date and you will pay the charges.  No one explained to me that the charges was going to change if I changed my DD date I would have left it as ease and only settle what I owe.  Yes  it was a error on my end and I will gladly pay the R50 reconnection as it was a honest mistake. But to treat me like this for one payment that I made late and charge me this month.  I pay my account very Month on time and this is the level of service I get from Multichoice No wonder people are cancelling there subscriptions.  And im Feeling the same way if you call form help and they treat you like that.  If they explained there process to me as I don’t work there then that would be helpful but no one explained anything to me.  I would like someone to get back to me with knowledge of what they are doing and also send their staff for proper customer service training.  and Maybe try and help the customers that keeps there business going.	0	1	0	0	1	0

My husband had to phone in again on 7 October 2017 to once again tell them the entire story as our service was suspended and again he was put through to someone by the name of Patricia who again confirmed his arrangement for payment to be 20 Ocotber 2017  NOW AGAIN it is suspended after 2 “managers” made arrangements with my husband!!!! I know of at least 3 people who is more than 3 months behind with payments and that are still able to watch dstv as their services have not been suspended yet. 1 family member is on price lock and stopped paying for 6 months and made arrangements to catch up payment and guess what they are still watching dstv, we are behind with 30 days and you refuse to reconnect our services with a standing arrangement.   I will be laying a complaint with hello peter as I feel that we are being discriminated against as I do know of countless people who have arrangements with your company.

During the confirmation phone call received from the consultant informing us that  our application was successful, she informed us that a debit order will be raised on our bank account on 24/03/2016 for a amount of R149 to release the shipment of the Explora. Delivery would have been within 7 working days  after successful receipt of the debit order amount.  The debit order was never raised on our bank account.

We were also told that we cannot phone the responsible department directly! We demanded an explanation for the unacceptable service and long time it takes.  On 28/4 @ 13:59 we received a call from a supervisor that promised us that he will handle our complaint personally and that someone will call us back within 24hrs. On 29/4 @ 13:53 we received a call with the explanation that our bank statement somehow got lost in the process and that is why the debit order was never instructed. We just need to send the statement again and  the debit order will go off on 3 May 2016.  We send the bank statement via email to a Linda Magongo on the same day.  3 May has come and passed and no money deducted from our account and STILL no Explora Price Lock Deal!!!

242	/dstv-multichoice/reviews/appalling-and-unethical-service-by-multichoice-2477411	Appalling and unethical service by MultiChoice Sometime in January, I received an e-mail promo from MultiChoice about the R599 deal to upgrade from the Compact to the Premium package until end of March. I then called (on 31 January, I think) to accept / activate the offer. I was charged a R152.13 pro rata fee as my debit date is the 25th of each month. Lo and behold, on the  26th of February, my bank account was billed R897.76 (full premium package fee I think!) instead of the accepted R599 special.  I called the contact centre to query this and was assured that the R298.76 over billed amount will be credited into my account for the next billing.   On 26 March, my account was billed the normal Compact package amount as the special would have come to an end.   It's been a really frustrating 2 weeks trying to get my money back as every consultant I chat to, promises me that my query is escalated to the billing department and I'm always promised that I will be sent an e-mail or called with an update to my query.   I am really upset over this appalling service by MultiChoice and am seriously contemplating terminating my account if this is how they treat their customers.

I called Multichoice on the 18th June 2019 to go over the amounts i have been paying over the last 8 months. Surprise surprise, apparently they have no referencing system hence they could not generate Ref# my total call time was from 18h14 till 19h28. During a span of three calls. Which you should take note that all of these calls were eventually released. At least i was savvy enough to jot down the names of the agents is spoke to. The service is fu....d up. Pardon my so called expressive language but am peeving angry at the moment. The useless people i spoke to are as follows:  1. Terrianne (supposedly TM) = 18 minutes before she dropped the call. 2. Phila ( the liar) who opted to bring a friend for a sup call needless to say she released the call as well. 3. Nonduduzo ( another liar) by the way i am still waiting to speak to her promised suervisor Vukelwa. Not sure between the two as to who released the call.

251	/dstv-multichoice/reviews/appalling-pricelock-account-mismanagement-and-poor-customer-service-2651788	Appalling Pricelock account mismanagement and Poor Customer service I took a DSTV on Price lock in 2017 end of November. I have been debited for it. I received in sms 's in November 2018 advising me that my contract is coming to an end and I would be debited R0. 00 as of 31 December 2018. But on 30 November 2018,  our services were Switched off. When I called DSTV to understand  the consultant advised that I needed to make payment in order to access my service again as my contract on pricelock had ended. She advised that I had over R240+ credit available on my acount and I am therefore only required to pay an additional R235 in order to get my services back. I made Payment immediatly and my services were restored. I Then discovered that the Extraview was not working and I called them back,  the call centre agent advised that I need to pay in R20 for the insurance on the singleview decoder. I mafe that Payment also immediatly after the call. On 1 December 2018 a debit of R559 went off my account. I reversed this Payment as I was advised to make a cash payment.  I called DSTV contact centre again and the agent advised that she would escalate my call to the relevant Pricelock department who would get back to me. She said she could not see the reversal on her side.  Fast forward to Friday,  28 December 2018,  I called DSTV to query my account because it said I was owing R1000+ on my account,  the agent advised that he would escalate my call to the Pricelock department Who would call me on Monday as the worked only from Monday to Friday.   I waited and the call never came,  on 1 January 2019 my account was debited with an Amount of R1049,  yet nobody from DSTV Price lock department has bothered to get back to me to resolve this issue.   I have recently just taken another decoder on Pricelock Which has not yet been installed because the installer has been fully booked,  I have No further Desire to continue with it due to this appalling  poor account management and Customer care. I had a fraudulent DSTV  Price lock decoder issue earlier in the year that I managed to deal with,  but this continued mismanagement of Customer accounts has left a bad taste in my mouth. They will call you to get business from you,  but will not bother to resolve your issues.   They can come collect this new decoder on Pricelock,  I have No interest of continuing with it as matters stand because I see issues arising with that too. It is still unwrapped in the delivery packaging. Return to sender. I am just over it.	0	0	1	0	1	1
252	/dstv-multichoice/reviews/appalling-service-208-2009661	Appalling Service! I called the Multichoice contact centre on Friday evening to have a new smartcard linked to my account. A consultant by the name of Refilwe Magopa took my call and the service rendered was Appalling! She did not listen to my request (assumed she know what I needed) which resulted in the call delaying unnecessarily. She was not interested in me as a customer and when I told that she is not listening to me, she had the audacity to ask me \Are you done?\ . She was rude and disrespectful. Consultants like her only tarnishes the company brand. Her supervisor, Ntombi Njoli spoke  to me thereafter however had no empathy. She couldn't care less of my dissatisfaction and was just interested in resolving the matter and getting off the the phone. I asked for her manager (Ndumeso) to call me back, to date I have not received a call. Ntombi promised that she will listen to the conversation between Refilwe and I and revert back to me within 48hrs, I'm still waiting for her call. I'm disgusted in the calibre of staff which I had to deal with on Friday. The experience on Friday, left a bitter taste in my mouth!	0	1	1	0	0	0
253	/dstv-multichoice/reviews/appalling-service-218-2019722	Appalling service  Very disappointed in Multichoice! I have spoken to 4 consultants within a month, and none of them managed to resolve my issue. This month I was charged R1119 for my dstv account, instead of being charge my normal rate of R425, or rather R459 because its gone up. Apparently, They were billing me for 2 decoders which does'nt make sense as I have been paying my normal rate since November last year, so I don't understand why this second decoder is active all of a sudden??? Anyway... The last consultant I spoke to on the 5th of April at 17:27, said that its an error with Multichoice and that R425 will be credited back into my bank account. She also said that the remaining balance will remain in my dstv as credit available. I still have not recieved my money and I will refuse to call the call centre again to resolve an issue that was doing in the first place 	1	0	0	1	1	1
254	/dstv-multichoice/reviews/appalling-service-2414748	APPALLING SERVICE So Friday we called DSTV to have our services upgraded to compact plus. Something happened and the agent suddenly had an error on their side and the services went off. Now I’ve been calling from Friday to today (Tuesday) about the same thing and my services are still not up. I call now and I get through to Thabang who takes me through the same process of troubleshooting the decoders. I tell him that still the services aren’t up. Thabang begins to suggest that the decoders might be faulty. I tell him I’m not playing that game. The decoders worked fine until we called to upgrade and after every agent we spoke to said the error was on DSTV system he wants to blame the decoders. So Thabang proceeds to work on it until it also gives him an error on their system and then he says he’s going to escalate it for me and would ask that I call back later. Can you imagine? Later when? How am I suppose to know when their system is fine. I tell him I want to speak to a supervisor because I need someone to call me back. Thabang also tells me that the people that have been helping me from Friday haven’t even left notes on my account. So Dumisani Radebe who’s the supervisor comes to the phone and he tells me that he will send and email to technical and call me back at twenty to twelve to make sure my services are up Today. I am waiting for his call. He promised on a recorded call to call me back. He better call back because I have a credit on my account and it’s the 5th day without service.	0	0	1	1	0	0

256	/dstv-multichoice/reviews/appalling-service-2436193	Appalling service Experienced an issue with my decoder, on the first call to the call center, they talked me through numerous ways to try to reset...Which didn't work and meant I needed to take my decoder in. Having been through this before and knowing I would be expected to replace the decoder, I decided to purchase a new decoder from Makro as the call centre at multichoice advised it would be an immediate activation once purchased.  When trying to register the new decoder, the Durban call centre was the most unhelpful and uninformative, they could not give me a reasonable explanation as to why they could not do what was needed, and kept asking me to try after an hour. After the THIRD hour, and fourth phone call (each of which lasted no less than 15mins), it seems my problem has finally been escalated, but still not resolved!	0	1	0	1	0	0

I cancelled my subscription as I was no longer using the service earlier this year using the DStv online account management facility which is my right.  I am then advised months later I  owe DStv R408.02. Nobody can tell me what this is for as my monthly Premium contract was R800 + I am now being harassed almost on a daily basis by Blake and Associates. In the beginning I was polite and tried to explain to the operators that the subscription was cancelled and that I owe nothing. The operators promise to make amends and rectify the issue. Guess what nothing is done and the harassment continues. This is shocking customer care. Please resolve this. I owe you nothing.	0	0	0	1	0	1

262	/dstv-multichoice/reviews/appalling-service-at-the-hands-of-a-dstv-call-centre-agent-2753434	Appalling service at the hands of a Dstv call centre agent!!! Yesterday I called the Dstv call centre because my decoder kept on rebooting itself. Musa Mazibuko (call centre agent) took my call and I experienced the worst service ever.  Firstly the line was so bad and I could hardly hear what she was saying, when I mentioned this to her she told me that there's nothing she can do because she's been moving around to find a better spot to no avail. I wondered how I was going to be assisted if I couldn't make out what she was saying. On top of that the background noise was deafening, to say the least. In spite of all of that I then proceeded to express my frustration at the fact that I've had to take my decoder to the Dstv centre because it was rebooting itself and I was given a new one. The new decoder which I've had for all of two months, was now doing the same thing. I then expressed my disappointment at the fact that I pay my premium and insurance every month and on top of that I must now use my airtime and petrol to either call or go to one of their centres. She then, rudely, interjected and told me that the premium I pay has nothing to do with the technical issues I'm experiencing - and this, after I told her that this issue is reoccurring in a space of two months (one would think that, as a call centre agent, she would understand that when you pay for a service you expect to get service!). She couldn't even help me (resolve an issue that is not related to the R994 premium that I pay every month) she advised me to go to a Dstv centre.  In my view Dstv does not even deserve a single star. I am appalled at the kind of non-service I received at the hands of Musa Mazibuko!!!  	0	1	0	0	0	0
263	/dstv-multichoice/reviews/appalling-service-from-dstv-2360630	APPALLING SERVICE FROM DSTV Since June this year when we  queried a R162.00 owing balance on our DSTV account and nobody from the DSTV call centre or  the DSTV office in Plettenberg Bay could explain why, although DSTV is paid every month for the service requested.  DSTV Plettenberg Bay eventually told me that I had phoned the DSTV call centre on 20 May 2017, (having already paid for the next month's DSTV package requested at 11.46 am on 20 May 2017) and was assisted by a  Gordon Mntambo who upgraded our service on 20 May 2017 - 7 June 2017.  Although the payment date is on the 21st of every month and I know that you cannot downgrade to  a lesser DSTV package on any other day but your payment date but you can upgrade at any time. In spite of repeated requests, by telephone to the DSTV call centre where a line manager who gave his name as Mntuthuko Nzimande and promised that he would get back to us over 9 days ago, and visits to DSTV Plettenberg Bay, to provide us with a copy of the telephone recording where the upgrade was requested, DSTV have now informed us that they have no copy of  the recording of the request,  yet have now again cut off the service, although it is paid up until 20 October 2017.  DSTV unable to provide a copy of the recording requesting the upgrade, the fact that one cannot downgrade a package until a payment is due for the month ( so I would only be able to get a downgrade on 20th of the month and not the 7th of the month), failure to get back to a client, and then cutting off the service 3 times while this dispute is being investigated, I think DSTV's service leaves a lot to be desired and it is no wonder people are leaving it.	1	0	1	1	1	0

To date no upgrade has been done. Been calling daily since the beginning of June 2019 but still not upgraded as promised. When I call in, it's consultants and team leaders all promise to escalate but never give feedback. I feel mislead by Multichoice's marketing, over promises me but under delivered. Just spoke to Portia whom advised nothing can be done unless I have the sms but I made it very clear to them that I lost my phone but did a sim swap. They clearly don't keep records as they're unable to retrieve my SMS which is pathetic. Considering cancelling my subscription as this is unacceptable and would not recommend their services at all, after so many years.	0	0	1	1	0	0

I'm writting this as a disappointed customer I have been endless billing issues with my price lock account that was acctivated on the 31/01/2018.  According to rhe agreement I should be paying an amount of R549.00 on monthly basis.   My account has been debited an amount of R965.14 which I do not understand it's for what ? I feel so violeted as a customer , I will be reservesing that amount and cancelling your debited order until I get a resolution to this problem .   Kindly note that I will be taking this escalation to the Social Media because I cannot be calling Multi Choice every month regarding the same issue that cannot be resolved by your consultance. This morning I spoke to Mbali Sikhakhane who did not give me a chance as a customer to expalined myself. She assumed that she knew what was query all about which I found very disturbing and disrespectful to talk over the customer.   Last month when I escalated the same query a document from the Billing Department was emailed to me stating that I do not have any any oustanding amount .   If this matter connot not be resolved within the next 24 hours, then I will be force to take it to  take legal actions.	1	1	0	1	0	1

I feel that whoever it is responded for the sake of responding and didn't take the time to investigate my query. Firstly I received same answer I have been getting for the last two months from that person . You keep telling me that the R599 promo didn't pull but no way forward on what you going to do about it, it's been three months now? At you telling me DSTV cannot raise a credit note for this? So that this can be resolved and I won't have to keep calling for rectification. Secondly you tell me you'll do my down grade 1 May but I had already phone last month requesting a downgrade and was told it will be done from 1 April and that never happened, so now what I need to now whose going to pay for the incompetence of your employees cause if you had taken the time to listen to recordings , you would have heard that the downgrade was long requested. So all I got was it will be done in May but what about my request for April. Thirdly you quick to tell me about what I owe Mara what about the credit that you owe me ? So basically your money is more important than mine? You switch off in a day when people owe but you take over three month to rectify outstanding amounts.	0	0	0	1	0	0

Up to today no delivery was made to us, instead the device was delivered on the 1st March 2018 to someone else.  The device and smart card was activated on my mothers name on 5 March 2018.    On the 2nd March 2018 I made a call to the call centre enquiring about the delivery and was told it was too soon that we should wait a couple of more days.  Waited and nothing happened.  On Monday, 12 March 2018, I contacted the call centre and was assisted by Ntombi (very helpful) who in turn handed my query over to the payment department.  I was told that someone would phone me within 24 to 48 hours.  Nobody phoned me whatsoever.  On Saturday, 17 March 2018, I took my mother to the offices in Randburg so that we could go and see what was going on.  We were assisted by a very helpful lady (Vuyokazi).  We were told that the payment plan department are supposed to assist us with this but their working days are from Monday to Friday.  She informed us that the matter would be given over to them on the 19th (Monday).  One phone call from the payment plan department was received and nothing after that.   The morning of the 20th I received a call from a gentlemen from FedEx Couriers that he is at my gate to collect a parcel for MultiChoice.  How on earth is this possible?  I was supposed to receive a package from MultiChoice.  Told the guy I do not have a package for MultiChoise and he left.  Yesterday, 21 March 2018, I received an SMS from MultiChoice informing that the collection is booked for today, 22 March 2018 and that FedEx will collect.  Even the billing on my mother's account is incorrect.  I really need someone to assist me now.  It is two days away from a month that we are struggling like this.  My mother has been a loyal subscriber for many years and now is being treated like this.  Can someone come to our rescue please.	0	0	1	0	0	0

Hence, you have not been debited so far. Once the Price Lock team adds the decoder on the system that's when you'll be debited.\  Its been nearly 2 weeks still not debited. I give the call center a call and they tell me my application is still in a \vetting\ status and not approved yet....  When the \087\ explorer guys called me they took my banking details address ID number etc did a credit check told me I was approved, so why does the call center have different information?  They Lady on the phone told me they have not verified any of my details, for example my ID number etc etc. What game are you guys playing? Was the person who handled my application incompetent or did they forget to do something?  Can someone from the Explorer Team please just call me and get this all sorted out, verify the details you need verified and get the ball rolling on my Explorer delivery please.  This has been a terrible process and its a miss on your end as I answer my phone give you all the details you want, yet no effort on your end to resolve this.  I hope to hear from you.	0	0	0	1	0	0

I never received any information about my account from multichoice thats why i continued paying the R360 until last month when they switched of my decoder without any warning and when i cobtacted them suddenly there was arrears of R1300 after all the months of nothing. After sending several emails with the settlement letters to different departments they rectified it but now they let me know im in arrears with R1900 for paying only R360. What am i to do because no one ever got in contact with me since last year that i started paying that amount to inform me that im in arrears.

281	/dstv-multichoice/reviews/arrogance-due-to-monopoly-by-dstv-multichoice-2730867	Arrogance due to monopoly by DStv (MultiChoice) Multichoice 's arrogance has taken to the next level as they forcing me into a relationship with them that has been damaged by them in the first place. They recently disconnected my services upon non-payment just over an hour after I have made the subscription payment of which I believe they were malicious with hellbent on their intention of charging me re-connection fee. After they suspended my subscription I informed them as a result of their action I am immediately cancelling my subscription (TERMS AND CONDITIONS: PAYMENT PLAN, point 7.2) and demand a full refund (that was 27 April 2019) but they responded that they cannot see my payment and I told them  I will wait. On Sunday (28 April 2019) my one decoder (primary) was reconnected instead without me issuing a contrary instruction to the one I gave the previous day. that without access and extra view (the package I always subscribed to). In addition to that and additional amount or R50.00 was added to my account upon my on-line inquiry. Two of their conditions were flouted in the latter instance as, i) You need to give instruction for re-connection, ii) after paying the mandatory R50.00 re-connection fee.I believe that even if it was a late payment I made the payment before the disconnection was executed and they only disconnected me upon seeing the payment to capitalize for their own gains. Since they refused to reconnect me immediately I then instructed to terminated the services immediately. The arrogance tag emanates from the fact that t they will NEVER give refund under circumstances irrespective of the fact that who's at fault but rather offer something in alternate of the refund.  I went back to engage multichoice representative upon my intention of cancelling the agreement and demanding a refund but he told that my disconnection in scheduled on the 26-May-2019 (future settlement date)	0	0	0	0	1	0

283	/dstv-multichoice/reviews/arrogant-call-center-agents-thieving-dstv-1999286	Arrogant call center agents/thieving dstv I stupidly decided to switch on my Dstv on the 17th of March. I don't pay via debit order because I only switch it on to watch rugby. On screen there was a message saying that I must dial *120*&^%^#, that gave me an amount that I needed to pay. Logged on to dstv and same amount reflected and I paid. As the contract is month to month(and NO WHERE did it state that I have to pay more) I paid the R 365.50. I called in to say that I have paid and that it now has to be switch on, the lady said there is still an amount outstanding for some odd reason, even after I dialed the *120* number and logged into [URL Removed] that was never mentioned. My dstv was disconnected yesterday and again I wasted time calling into the dstv call center ref number  ********** 6-I18. There I had to deal with 2 very arrogant call center agents that spoke over me started laughing at me and never even tried to help me, all they said is that I have to pay and extra R 200!!!! Really for reruns, for a contract that is month to month and even after I paid the R 365.50 that was quote on the dstv and mobile site. I want to get a full refund or get my dstv switched back on till the end of the month. But not hopeful. 	0	0	0	0	1	1

287	/dstv-multichoice/reviews/atrocious-dstv-service-such-a-disappointment-2682876	Atrocious DSTV service, such a disappointment!!! DSTV is quite ****ty to be frank..from their connectivity policy down to their call centre employees who never go above and beyond to assist their customers. I know fully well that I owe them a subscription amount and have called them at least 10 times since the year began and not even their supervisor could tell me what happened to the escalations that they had put through to their finance dept. They will just tell you that it's not the consultants that disconnect you, but the system, which is ridiculous because I paid two days ago, I even made an arrangement for 6 months, which I have stuck to, yet I'm having to call them every day to reconnect so my daughter can watch TV. This is not how business is done. I am in the same industry and I go all the way for my disgruntled customers especially. When escalations are presented to a dept, the authority needs to make sure it's implemented and the customer communicated to every step of the way. But here I am, sitting here wondering how many other customers have been closing their accounts and moved on to streaming online rather. I'm not bitter, I'm just disappointed because some of us actually pay for our DSTV accounts, even though we are behind in payments. Their service is atrocious, on all fronts.	0	1	0	1	1	0
288	/dstv-multichoice/reviews/atrocious-service-2473321	Atrocious service I am so angry right now. Multi Choice is just full of ****** crocks. I have been calling Dstv since February with the same concern using my own Airtime and have still have not been refunded my money owed to me and they have the nerve to still debit me the full amount. So in Jan I upgraded to premium as per the promotion they were running at the time to pay R599. I paid more than what I should and now I have a balance of R200+ on my account which was supposed to be credited to my February debit order. When it was not done and was debited the full payment I humbly agreed that it can be credited to this months debit order and guess what the ****** fools have not credited me my hard earned money and debited me the full amount. I called them on Friday and reminded them of my credit balance due to me and they still take me for a fool.   When you have missed payment by a day they cut off your viewing immediately without any call to put you on term but when it's time for them to credit my money it takes an arm and a leg.  It does not help that when you call them you literally have to wait about 30 min at the very before getting through. Talk about getting atrocious service.	0	0	0	1	0	0
289	/dstv-multichoice/reviews/atrocious-service-2539901	Atrocious service This review is in reference to a Multichoice installer located @ 3, Lifestyle Corner, Hendrik Potgieter Rd & Nic Diederichs, Roodepoort, Johannesburg, 1732.  I've had a single decoder setup for over a year and when my girlfriend had moved in with me she had brought her decoder and we decided we'd get the Xtra view option.  I went physically to the store and explained that I would like someone to come setup the second decoder which will be the xtra view decoder but also have both decoders push a signal to my sons room. So pretty simple, two decoders operating seperately and then both decoders sending signal to a second bedroom.  The installer comes and I explain everything; we'd not done the change of ownership as of yet but the installer assured me that once change of ownership is complete everything will work. This was the Sunday that the setup occurred and R3000 later.  Monday I do the change and then get home from work and now the second decoder, which is a PVR decoder has been setup as the primary upstairs however now downstairs isn't working (error that it’s not getting a response from the primary decoder) and the signal to the third television is horrid compared to what it was looking like on the Sunday before the tech left.  I call DSTV call centre and explain the entire situation; The agent asks me to explain how the cables on both decoders are setup to which he then explained that it won’t work in its current setup and I'd have to change the cabling of the RF's and had to reset the decoders to default. That still didn’t work and the only way eventually we got it to work was the primary decoder had to be reverted back to my old decoder and that the PVR won’t work. I said that’s fine, we'd sorted it out with the Dstv installer.  I wait till the Saturday after the work week and go into the store again, explain what happened and I'm told that they will send someone later that day. Saturday comes and goes, no one calls, no one rocks up. Sunday... same thing.  Monday I call the store and it's a new excuse, a new apology, a new story and a new broken promise - they will have a technician call me to make arrangements. Monday passes, Tuesday, Wednesday - nothing.  Thursday I call again - and guess what - new excuses, new stories, new apologies and a new broken promise. They will send someone first thing Saturday morning (not the guy who originally installed it because he was on leave, I was told specifically they will send someone else) - I make arrangements that I'm home and available Saturday... Saturday passes and still nothing.  I call early the Saturday afternoon and guess what - new excuses, new story, new apologies and a new broken promise - as soon has his guys are done with their current job they will come through.  Saturday passes, Sunday passes - no calls, nothing. Monday morning at 07:45 they call - I ignore because now I'm done but then they send a SMS - can someone come through now... on a Monday, while I'm at work.  So after R 3000 I still didn’t get the service I wanted and have been treated to utterly atrocious customer care; it's always a new story and a new excuse and zero effort after having received their money.  I do not recommend these installers - ever! If still chosen to do an installation be sure that everything is 100% working, tested and tested and confirmed before payment because they do not care after having received payment.	0	0	1	1	0	0

291	/dstv-multichoice/reviews/atrocious-service-from-multichoice-2377341	Atrocious Service from MULTICHOICE I call the call centre on the 25th of September to downgrade my DSTV service as I felt that the Premium package tho preferred is a bit to expensive for my budget considering the fact that my family is hardly home during the day. I requested the compact package and they said that it would be R652.00 with re-connection etc. I paid and then realised that is the wrong compact package. I believe it was plus or something to that effect. After fix that, the consultant told me that my next payment due would be only R150.02 by the 21st of October 2017. I jotting same down on my Calendar to pay. Oh lo and behold on the 18th October I received a message stating that R257.49 is due.. so I am confused as hell at this point but I call the call centre on the 21st to confirm. I explain the story to the apathetic Consultant who just kept saying that R257.47 is the due amount. I said to her go get that recording and listen to it and I will pay what was advised. She said she would log a call and they will get back to me . Did not hear a single word from DSTV for 6 days and On the 26th my service is suspended. I call the call centre again. Even requested them to call me back as I was using my airtime from my mobile at home. Just to be told its an inbound centre... SO MUCH FOR SERVICE! Explain the stupid story again and they advised that they will NOW speak to a Supervisor. I was advised that I can pay the amount that was communicated and they will re-connect me I proceeded to do same. So today I received an SMS stating that my account is suspended and I have to pay R195.69. So to say that I am LIVID is an understatement!!! I to this day I have still not had a call or explanation or apololgy regarding my complaint raised the 21st of Oct. Is this the kind of show that MULTICHOICE now runs.. Provide incorrect pricing. Ignore customers. Avoid logging customer complaints or even follow up after a complaint is raised. Yes it may not be that biggest amount and I assume that is why MULTICHOICE may be treating my complaint with such disdain, but I can guarantee you that I will make every person I know whether is via social media, colleagues, family or even a random forums I attend of the horrendous service I have received from MULTICHOICE	1	1	0	1	1	1

I had to call you guys to tell you please take the money because it has not gone off and its half way through the month. I then also get told because my debit date is on the 1st of every month (which by the way is an option you offered me) is actually the worst day to have chosen because I get told stupid **** that some months have 31 days and some months have 30 days and OMG! there is a month that has 28 days.

I went back to that agency and got a stinking attitude from one of the consultants with poor customer service who didn’t care at all about my situation and was told to go to N1 city. I am tired of this back and forth because I went to N1 and I was just once again reassured the matter has been fixed. This morning I wake up again with my dstv disconnected. At this point I am sick and tired because I paid my money for a service that I’m now not getting.

She has excuses for each request were Teamleaders are concerned. I asked to be transferred back to Ncebakazi she reply there's no way that can be done as it's a huge call center.  Ok, I asked to speak to a senior she  refused and ended up placing me on hold and the feedback she gave was that there's only one Teamleader and currently busy. Huge call center with only 1Teamleader what a service DSTV. I then ask for her to take down my details and ask the Teamleader(Tebogo) to get back to me, she reply I don't  think he'll call you, just like that, shocked. Got so furious as she's giving answers for a Teamleader without even handing my request in. She confirmed to me that the Teamleader will not find Ncebakazi.as she's doesn't work there. I spoke to Ncebakazi from the same number I was speaking to her on. Judging from the responses she gave, I might not receive a call from anyone as she won't hand in my request.

316	/dstv-multichoice/reviews/bad-attitude-by-call-centre-agent-kyle-0215082222-2445645	Bad Attitude by Call centre agent Kyle  ********** 222 I called the DSTV call centre in Cape Town at 19:41 on  ********** 222 to do a simple change of ownership.After selecting option nine,my call was transferred to an agent who was clearly breathing on the telephone,but not answering the call as he is suppose to do.After I said “hello,hello” about four times,the agent said “Hi,you speaking to Kyle or some name like that”.The call centre agents voice was VERY unclear and it was evident that he was not in the mood to work as he kept on repeating what I was saying(2/3times) and I had to ask him “why are you keeping on repeating what I am telling you”.I said I want do a change of ownership and he said oh ok “go to dstv.com download it and come into dstv with both copies of ID’s”.The information provided in a very “I dont care attitude” I already knew.I called because online DSTV stated that a customer can call the contact centre to do the change of ownership,thus why I called.Your call centre agent said I cannot do it over the phone and that he will look into it and wanted to say goodbye whereafter I replied “Please go get your supervisor”.I was put on hold,after 3 minutes he returned to say the same old story that customers are told”my supervisor is busy”.I was again placed on hold and then the call was disconnected.  If DSTV contact centre management knows how to do Quality Assurance on their agents calls,this agent would fail the call completely.He did not answer the call,only he’s breathing could be heard (hoping the customer would put down).He’s tone of voice was horrible and very unprofessional.You could hear he didnt care about the query and was not interested in actually doing the job that he applied to do and for which he  gets paid!He obviously did not receive proper training or was not screened correctly during the interview selection process as I have never spoken to such a grossly incompetent agent at DSTV like him!!!!!  Your DSTV forum clearly states that you can call the call centre to do the change of ownership!  Ship up or ship out!  I want this call to be listened to and action taken against this agent.I also want the agent to call me to apologise for he’s attitude and incompetence and then you can effect my change of ownership.

Matsobane didnt really want to speak i tried so many times to ask him to speak up as i could hardly hear him and his response was that,that was the loudest he could speak and he didn't give a damn if i could hear him or not.....so our conversation was really bad and even when he was asking me some questions he didn't even try to clarify them..it was like i made a mistake for calling dstv. If he really wasn't in the mood to talk he could have transferred me to other agents.  I also thought dstv had that survey where you have to rate the call but to my surprise i wasn't put through to the survey.  Matsobane if you are working at a call centre where you are dealing with people everyday you have to learn to speak with customers well and you should remember that you are there to give us service. We are using our airtime to call and paying our monthly premium  then again we have to deal with people who don't want to talk to us? Why continue having a dstv account if this is the kind of the attitude that we have to get we need help!	0	1	0	0	0	0
319	/dstv-multichoice/reviews/bad-attitude-rudeness-useless-by-call-centre-agent-kamohelo-mya-2648442	Bad attitude, rudeness, useless by Call Centre Agent KAMOHELO MYA Bad attitude, rudeness, useless by Call Centre Agent KAMOHELO MYA. Earlier today, Sunday, 23rd December 2018 at 09h27AM, I called DStv (MultiChoice) for assistance with activating a new decoder, and was attended to by KAMOHELO MYA, who was very rude, had a bad attitude, and was completely useless. The total call duration was more than 4 minutes, afterwhich KAMOHELO MYA was exceptionally useless in helping with a very simple request of activating my decoder. I stand to be corrected but in my opinion, HE DOES NOT HAVE WHAT IT TAKES TO DEAL WITH PEOPLE, HE HAS NO CLUE OF WHAT PROFESSIONALISM AND RESPECT IS, AS US, THE WAY HE CONDUCTED HIMSELF DOES NOT IN ANY WAY REPRESENT DStv (MultiChoice) for the good company that they are!!!  I am saying this because KAMOHELO MYA IS THE ONLY PERSON WHO DEMONSTRATED SUCH A HIGH DEGREE OF RUDENESS, DISRESPECT, AND USELESSNESS from all the other people that I have ever been attended to when I contacted DStv (MultiChoice) Call Centre in the past.  TO MAKE IT EVEN WORSE, KAMOHELO MYA DID NOT EVEN SO CALLED UPDATE ANY OF THE DETAILS THAT HE CONTINUED TO WASTE MY TIME ON, CLAIMING TO UPDATE ON THEIR SYSTEM.   @KAMOHELO MYA: YOU MUST LEARN TO RESPECT DStv (MucliChoice) Customers  AND STOP BEING FULL OF YOURSELF, IT SUCKS AND IT'S UNNECESSARILY FRUSTRATING!!!  @Selina Seshabela: I hope you will you the aforementioned call that I made, and address KAMOHELO MYA's rudeness accordingly so as to prevent other fellow DStv (MultiChoice) Customers from the unnecessary and undesired rudeness, bad attitude, and uselessness demonstrated by, and frustration caused by KAMOHELO MYA. I thank you in advance.  @Lungile: Many thanks to you again for your exceptional service, for managing to assist me successfully in less than half the amount of time that was wasted by KAMOHELO MYA. He should consider asking you to teach the meaning of respect, good attitude, efficiency, and professionalism. Thank you.	0	1	0	0	0	0
320	/dstv-multichoice/reviews/bad-attitude-towards-account-faults-on-their-side-2406576	BAD ATTITUDE TOWARDS ACCOUNT FAULTS ON THEIR SIDE Ons is al vir etlike jare intekenare van DSTV en het al by verskeie geleenthede probleme ondervind met hulle rekeningstelsel.  Nou onlangs was daar probleme aan hulle kant waar hulle ons dienste opgeskort het en ons vir 'n lang ruk moes sukkel sodat hulle ons weer gekonnekteer kon kry.   Hulle het toe aangedui dat die price lock wat ons op die rekening gehad het, nou verstryk het en dat ons normale tariewe moet begin betaal.   Dus ook die rede waarom hulle die dienste opgeskort het.  Ons het nooit iewers aansoek gedoen of geteken vir price lock nie so ek weet nie waar kom hulle daaraan nie.  Van daar af, word ons dienste elke week opgeskort al is ons rekening op datum betaal.  Op een stadium het iemand gepraat van die debietorder wat teruggestuur is onbetaald - daar was nog nooit 'n debietorder op die rekening vir die afgelope aantal jare nie.  Volgende keer was dit weer as gevolg van die price lock wat veroorsaak het dat ons agterstallig is.   Elke keer word die rekening na 'n supervisor verwys of die price lock afdeling, word ons belowe dat hulle sal terugskakel en indien hulle wel terugskakel, word ons die versekering gegee dat alles uitsorteer is en ons dienste nie weer beëindig sal word nie.  Hierdie week was ons weer afgeskakel en toe is ek meegedeel dat daar 'n debietorder van ongeveer R400.00 is wat teruggestuur is, soos reeds genoem is daar geen debietorder op die rekening nie.  Weereens is ek belowe dat hulle sal ondersoek instel, die rekening expedite en terugskakel, wat nie gebeur het nie.  Ek het sopas 'n SMS ontvang om dringend die rekening te vereffen.   Die rekening is op datum nog al die jare.  Elke maal as mens soontoe skakel moet jy vir ure aanhou, gesels, jouself identifiseer en dit alles geld wat uit my sak uitkom vir oproepe ens en niemand doen niks daaraan nie.  Ek het hulle Maandag meegedeel dat ek hulle net tot Maandagaand kans gee om die rekening uit te sorteer anders neem ek dit verder, wel niks het gebeur nie en nog steeds sukkel ons.  DSTV wil net geld hê en dit is ook die rede waarom hulle aandring dat kliënte debietorders teken, sodat hulle kan geld vat uit die mense se bankrekeninge soos dit hulle pas.  Ek sal dit waardeer indien u die aangeleentheid kan ondersoek asb.	1	0	0	1	1	1

I have been in contact over the last 6 months with DSTV Call Centre with regards to my account.I went on the Price Lock in Feb 2016 and it has been the worst experience of my life.I made numerors calls to the centre and I have been promised to get called back  by the Price lock team but promises after promises.I normally was on the call for 30 to 45 minutes at a time,running up my cellphone and landline bills.Do they care,I think not.Over the last few months,there have been helpful agents and I was advised in July,to not pay my account because I was being double charged'Wait for Price Lock Team to call back and rectify,this happened a few times but to date I am still waiting.....I have made manual payments ect and there has been confusions of when my Price Lock started ect.When I do speak to the supervisor,there are are helpful ones and not so helpful ones.One phoned me back at 10pm in the evening but I was sleeping....he did try again but I was driving home.When I contacted DSTV in Feb,I spoke to a lady and advised her that I am availble betwwn 8 to 11 and after 3 to 8pm.This was never recoreded on the system.What disappointed me the most that when I contacted DSTV yesterday evening,I explained to them my situation again,the lady was very rude and after I told her that I have a commitment to attend a another engagement,she frankly did not care.I spoke to her Supervisor and advised him of the same thing and he made it seem that I was at fault for havinf another engagement and could not talk.He also lied to me that he was referring me to a Mangaer (Melise Forte) because that person never call me to date.I phoned in again whilist I was travelling to my function and spoke to another lady who read back what was written and it was not close to what was discussed with me and what I said.I am utterly disapoointed by the lies and dishonesty of the staff.All calls are recorded so we should be in a position to check status of calls that I made for last 6 months.I have been inconvienced with no DSTV and bad attitude,poor service and mostly dishonesty and lies from staff.The staff are incompetent and advise that I have recived from different agents have all been questionable....Do I expect a response....??????????? who knows with the poor service I have recieved...I think it is the norm of how they do business.They even gave me the wrong number for complaints...I was promosed to be called this morning but yet to recieve the call.Await in anticipation...??????????????	1	1	1	1	1	0

329	/dstv-multichoice/reviews/bad-bad-company-2477256	BAD! BAD COMPANY I'm very disappointed with this company, Last month i couldn't afford to pay  my account so my services were suspended  which I understood. so late last month I made payment of R450 for my compact account which my services were reactivated immediately after I made payment however there was an outstanding amount of R223 which I didn't understand why should I pay +- R673 for my services to be  reactivated which almost doubles the amount I should pay for the compact account . Last night i got an sms saying my Dstv has been stopped i need to pay R223.53 of which i honestly don't how ? & why . My understanding is if i ddn't pay my services for that particular month. All i need to pay is my subscription & R50 for Reconnection  which I made R450 payment for . we tried last night to make  R100 payment on top of that still no connection. Really  MULTICHOICE takes advantage of poor people. it such a waste of time even to call their call centre cos you get transferred from pillar to post until you run out of airtime. still no decency to even call you back. I hope & pray that one day they can value their customer. I doubt if it was them in our shoes they wouldnt want to be treated like this.

341	/dstv-multichoice/reviews/bad-billing-and-service-1955826	Bad billing and service We applied for the dstv promotion in November 2015, but never took the option and bought our own explorer.  We had to phone each month since to cancel the debit order option that we did not choose.  We made cash payments and each month, they are taking money from our account also.  Each month I'm being told, that the cash deposit is going against the DPP, which we do not have and each month I have to phone. My subscription is costing me in excess of R900 each month, cause I have to phone each month. When we reverse our payment,  cause we made a cash deposit, our service is disconnect.   Each month these idiots are correcting the error, but it's just reoccurring. They should have a negative rating on their service for us to respond to, then you'll get a true reflection of their service.  I have sent them emails,  to which there has been no response. We are paying a lot of money, to which the service should be better.    ID  ********** 202089	1	0	1	1	1	0

I have been a customer since it was only Mnet and have been paying  my account via EFT since then without failing once.  For the second time now in a short while, I get the SMS that I have not paid. So I email my proof of payment made on 28 February to the appropriate email address plus to two additional ( senior? ) persons in accounts. Day before yesterday I receive another SMS, I again send my proof to the three addresses .  Yesterday, they cut my service.!  I immediately phone the billing department and kick up a fuss.  They reconnect my service after establishing that they  made a mistake. I then send them an email expressing my dissatisfaction to the three email addresses, and request an acknowledgement of my email and for a Manager to call me. Needless to say.....no response , except looking at my account, they have debited me with a R 50.00 reconnection fee !  Who do these people think they are  and do they think they are dealing with *****s ?  I clearly mentioned in my email that failing a response from them I shall seriously consider cancelling this outrageously priced service, which I am now  sure I should .

I CAN SAY FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MY LIFE USING THE SERVICES THE CLIENT SERVICE WAS APPAULING. I HAD TO CALL 5 times to get my 2nd decoder activated. Firstly the marketers stated she would not recognize due to the fact she is fairly knew and I should preserve for any person to similarly assist,, That was on the thirty first May or 1st of June. After holding on the lone for more than 20 min and therefore I had to drop the call and name once more and after the fifth name I got assistance.  I requested for the equal offerings as of my existing account that means the price must also be due on the 25th which was agreed upon with the agent that initiallu assisted. On Saturday the 15th of June I obtained a sms that my was once deactivated due to non-payment of +- 300 but the sms noted 779.04 once once more simply like the other time no one was once in a position to assist. On that name I again held for a supervisor up till my airtime ran out. After a few min my services had been switched on and consequently did now not see the need for every other name to be made. Today I acquired every other sms and now you can think about the frustration I had, I referred to as once more and used to be suggested to hold of a supervisor for extra than 5 min. Airtime ran out once more and had to purchase airtime and make another call. I spoke to this Team leader referred to as Vuyo Tsotsa who apologised for the inconvenience and I wasn’t joyful at all with the service and I was once on the smartphone for extra than 25 min, I asked for a manager and she said they were in a assembly and I requested to be known as by means of 10 and now its 10:20 and no one has tried to called me.

347	/dstv-multichoice/reviews/bad-communication-2381952	Bad communication! I had a child account with Multichoice was canceled and I was advised by Multichoice that the premium will remain as is for October 2017 and full price will insue from end November.   I received an SMS that my account was suspended on 01 November to which I contacted your cust service department and was informed that I owe you R550???? I was advised that all this money was owed because I didn't pay the full premium amount. When I explained the situation to the cust advisor, he had to call his supervisor then advised that I speak to the company I worked for, which I don't understand because if you advised it initially, why do I need to speak to my previous employer now?  My intention was to change the package over and explained that to the agent who said he can do it now and advised a new amount that needs to be paid.   My question is if I  paid in advance for my previous package last month shouldn't the package change have been instated by month end when the last package is null and void that I have already paid for? If so, why was this not explained to me but instead the change over done immediately with me assuming that last month's payment was last month and no proper information given to be fair to the me as the customer. Why are your customer service advisors so poor in communication and more interested in lining your pockets and not doing their jobs properly.	1	1	0	0	1	1

I informed her about her rudeness and requested to speak to her supervisor. I waited for  almost 30 minutes . I dropped the phone and called again. I spoke to Princess I narrated the story to her . she informed me that there are no supervisors asupervisort night and she gave me a number to call during the day. After a lengthy discussion she called the supervisor and I realised that she was lying. The supervisor then dropped the phone.  This irritated me more. I called again I spoke to a supervisor. He promised yo listen to the conversation and then come back to me in ten minutes. I have been waiting for his call for the past 5 Hours. Multi Choice  does not have a competitor hence they behave in this manner. It is an arrogant company with rude employees if there are any. The problem remains unresolved because of this unfortunate conduct.  I want this to be attended to urgently. They wasted my time and airtime.	0	1	1	0	0	0

Some weeks ago I phoned Multichoice to check how much im suppose to pay and when are they going to debit my account. I was told im not an annual subscriber and a whole lot of incorrect information. The lady told me they were offline and she will help resolve as soon as they are online. In Dec my account was debited for a monthly subscription. I phoned multichoice to check what was happening. Again it was a long story that didn't make sense ,the lady I spoke to she was helpful and I was happy with her service unfortunately she could not help because she needed her supervisor to intervene. She promised her supervisor will call me back which never happened. Sometime in Dec  I received an sms that said R1650 will be debited from my account for my annual subscription. This didn't make sense because I know it should be more than this. Few days ago I went to the centurion walk in multichoice centre. I was helped by Keneilwe (I think). She was very helpful, good customer care and I was happy with her service. I showed her the sms and she was as surprised also. I still didn't agree with the explanation for the dec debit order. Anyway I paid my annual subscription helped by Keneilwe. This morning I woke up to an sms that multichoice has debited R1650 from my account. I am furious and very unhappy.	1	0	1	0	0	1

358	/dstv-multichoice/reviews/bad-customer-service-2367641	BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE Good day,   I have been billed by DSTV on the 16th October 2017  for a Showmax subscription which has expired on the 13th October 2017. They seem to think that I should have paid for the full month of August when my free trial for Showmax ended on the 13th August 2017 at midnight. My new subscription for the following month 14 August to 14 September was debited to my account on the 15th August. DSTV debited my account 3 times with R99 when I only enjoyed the benefits of Showmax for Two Months. This does not make sense as my free trial ended the 13th August and my subscription seized on the 13th October of which cancellation date was the 28 September 2017 and my debit order date is on the 15th. Kindly rectify this, as judging from the service I received both from Showmax and DSTV  they will lose me as a client for life. The agent was rude and did not want to even understand the whole situation and proceeded to enforce her own obscure view. I am dissappointed and even going to cancel this Dstv debit order.

369	/dstv-multichoice/reviews/bad-customer-service-2625130	Bad Customer Service On 16/11/2018 I called DSTV to request an application for price-lock. The operator told me that my request will be escalated to the price lock team and they will call me back within 24 hours. On 19/11/2018 (more than 24 hours later) I receive the following missed calls: @ 11:37 -  **********  - Rang 2 seconds @ 11: 41 -  **********  - Rang 3 seconds @ 11:43 -  **********  - Rang 6 seconds @ 11:47 -  **********  - Rang 2 seconds Not one of these calls could be answered as I am not related to the Flash. When I try to call back any of the above numbers, an automated voice tells me that the number does not exist. I Googled the numbers and it shows that it is a DSTV installer number. I call DSTV back and ask them about this, they tell me that this is okay to have missed the calls as it doesn't help if the installer calls before the price-lock team has called as they still need to deliver my decoder and dish to me before there is a use for the installer, I should just wait for the price-lock call and take it from there. So I wait. On 21/11/2018 I call them again, and ask what is going on, the operator tells me that it is strange that they have not called me yet, as they are really not that busy and that they are supposed to call me back within 24 hours of the request, she will send the request again. Low and behold, on 22/11/2018 I get another call @ 10:17 from  ********** , which I fail to answer because I work in a call centre and was on another call. As soon as I am done with the call, I call DSTV again, and ask if there is not a number that I can call for the price lock team as this is getting ridiculous, No, she says, give me a time on which they can call you and I will resend your request... At the rate this is going, it seems that I will never be getting a call from the price-lock team.	0	0	0	1	0	0

When I got to speak to one of the consultants there, he assisted with the signal and I asked him about the debit order and what I had heard the IVR saying I owe. I asked that he helps with that to which he told me that he cannot because it’s a billing issue and that he would get someone from the billing department to contact me the same day still. So, no one called and the debit order went off.  Today I decide to call again seeing no one is calling me and I needed assistance with this billing issue, I got through to the switchboard and I specifically asked for the billing department and the lady said I will transfer you, I got through to Shenalie Beeraratalu (Spelling of names may be incorrect) after she could not get my cell number and my ID correct 4 times, she then told me that she cannot assist me because I need to contact the billing department, then I asked her what the number was, to my shock, she gave me the same number I had dialled  ********** 00, when I told her that I dialled that number, asked for billing department then I got through her, she got a bit annoyed and kept quiet then came back and said okay try this number for billing. At this point I am now also boiling because, since yesterday I have been calling with my airtime and asking for assistance from multichoice and so far I am getting incompetent agents that aren’t even sympathetic towards me, instead they want the call done or transferred to some other department. They don’t care that I need my money that was debited and still using money to call them. I then decided that seeing that she doesn’t have listening nor communication s****s that I need to speak to her manager, guess what, she makes me an idiot and a fool and she lies and says her manager is in a meeting, she in fact says all managers are in a meeting, when I asked her what her managers name was she again pauses, then later comes back and try explain why I was debited and when she again fails, I remind her that I asked for her managers name, she then gave it to me very fast so I couldn’t hear what she was saying, eventually I came up with Vivica Rampal to what she was saying fast and spelling with no interest in her tone. I then said to her, I am not hanging up until she gets someone that can assist me and tell me what is going on because I don’t trust them anymore seeing that no one has called me since I had requested yesterday, I am at a point of not trusting anything the agents are telling me because they do not do as they promise. She then put me on hold, went for a good 15 minutes, came back and said her manager said she will attend to my query when she gets my details, I asked her to go back and ask her if when can I expect the money back in my account, she didn’t she simply kept on being stubborn and telling me that she will escalate my issue (This to me tells me that she isn’t willing to go ask her manager so I can get TUT on when I am getting my refund). I spent another good 20 minutes with ere going back and forth, her being stubborn to do what I asked and me simply insisting to speak to a manager because she was failing. This went on for some time until I could hear someone instructing her on what she must say to me at the back, I then stopped her and asked if why can’t the person talking at the back take the call herself. The person that took the call was now Suvaisha Keoter****h, I asked her who she was and she said she was a manager, didn’t even greet nicely and ask if what my concern was, she simply went straight to saying “yes so I was looking at your account and…” so, then I stopped her and I asked if ho Vivica was and she said it’s one of the managers and that they were not in a meeting and that they were discussing something and just couldn’t come to take my call so, she (Suvaisha Keoter****h) instructed the agent to just say that they are in a meeting (now bare in mind that the call is almost to an hour) so I asked if they resorted to lying to me while I need assistance and wasting my airtime that no one is paying for there, she responded that we were busy with our boss, I asked if who her boss was, she then said it’s Trevor Naidoo and again like the agent, she hesitated giving me the names and when she said the surname she was already irritated and saying very fast so I couldn’t hear. I decided to explain what my concern was and she said yes, i see we debited twice and that we need to pay you 100+ back then I asked her when my account was up to date when I last made payment on the 25th and she theeeen tells me that I have two decoders.   Now basically this whole time it turns out that when I reconnected my services with the first consultant on the 28th of February, that that agent didn’t disconnect the old decoder as I had requested. I tell her that the old decoder was disconnected on the 28th of Feb, this is according to the agent I spoke to then. She then tells me that well, on her side it shows that I have two decoders as thought this was my problem or the agent that didn’t disconnect correct and has nothing to do with her. I asked for now Trevor Naidoo’s numbers because the agent and managers on the floor couldn’t be bothered with my concern and they seemingly cannot give me any assurance that this will be sorted as a matter of urgency seeing that I repeatedly said on the recorded line that I was hungry and that the debited my food money. She then told me sorry, we cannot give our superiors numbers, I then asked her for the contact number of the manager in the billing department and still she refuse telling me that she doesn’t have they contact number and that she has a call centre number, meaning, I needed to call again, hold on the line and repeat my story yet no one is buying me the airtime to call them when the mistake has been from their side. She didn’t even offer the name or email of the manager/supervisor on the billing department. She kept telling me that there is nothing she can do and that she will escalate, at some point told me that I will get a call with 2 to 24 hours (again no sense of urgency seeing that I mention I was hungry and the money debited was for food). I ended up ending the call because it was now over an hour and she was getting rude because she was no shouting at me and literally sounding like someone who was done with my complaint and super annoyed. Bottom line is, I am still hungry, no call has been made to me since yesterday, my money is not in my account and I have service charges for the debit order, my airtime bill and a rude service from the manager from the Durban call centre. I am going to send this complaint to every platform I see for Multichoice and their poor service and lack of care for customers. This is not the first time when I contact the centre and I get through to people that think that I should take their incompetence because they feel that they hold the cards yet I am a paying customer. Multichoice doesn’t do me favours so I fail to understand why my concern or complaint is not handled as an emergency when I even when to the levels of embarrassing myself telling them that I have no other money.	1	1	1	1	0	0
373	/dstv-multichoice/reviews/bad-customer-service-2737922	Bad customer service I received bad customer service from DSTV , I made payment for the month of May on the 30th of April and i forgot to put in my reference number on the as proof of which payment was traced and they could pick up it was from me as it was an EFT payment. my problem started when i got disconnected and they said payment was not received, i sent them the proof of payment last week Sunday and i was connected same time and yet today this morning i was disconnected again as they said there was no reference on the payment  made. i can account to not putting my reference but this is a huge inconvenience to me as i had to make countless calls to the call center explaining myself over and over again about the same thing. I  am highly  frustrated and annoyed as i am using money to make these calls for a payment that they can clearly see that it was from me.  I also received a email saying i need to make payment and yet i have paid already. Please advise what needs to be done.  Looking forward to your response.	0	0	0	0	1	0

The consultant i spoke to told me that i should get a sworn affidavit and certified Id copy and bring it with the decoder to there offices in Randburg and they will swop it out for me due to the fact that i have insurance.

381	/dstv-multichoice/reviews/bad-customer-service-and-reneging-on-an-offer-2640301	Bad Customer Service and Reneging on an Offer I took up a premium subscription with Dstv on the 24th of November 2018.  The consultant assisting me advised me I can get premium for R699 if I do not downgrade.  The price would be about 3 months if I remember correctly then after I pay the full premium price.  I agreed and asked how much I need to pay then and was advised R728 after he made his calculations.  I have since logged into my self service and noticed I had R894 due for 25 December 2018.  This obviously meant no R699 package was added.  I called your customer service and spoke to Hlengiwe who told me they need to listen to call and get back to me. That never happened. I called today and spoke to Duncan who said he is a team leader.  He was very arrogant and dismissive.  He told me he is busy he will assist tomorrow. I asked to speak to his manager. He told me his manager is also busy but will call me by 16:00.  That call back never came.  I spoke to Thobile after 18:00.  She also did not do anything to help and I am still in the same position I was in.  All I keep getting told is I will be called back and the call backs never come.  Why offer me something then turn back and change without informing me? Why are you refusing for me to listen to the call? Why are you refusing to honor what your consultant offered me?	1	1	1	0	0	1

386	/dstv-multichoice/reviews/bad-customer-service-unfairly-treated-2779463	Bad Customer service, unfairly treated On Friday 21 June 2019 I took my decoder to a walk in centre in Columbine Crossing and I was assisted by a gentleman by the name of Themba. Just before they could close, he told me that their system is down and he cannot finish the swap, meaning that I have to come back the following day. On Saturday morning I went back again, I spoke to him and told me to sit down as he was busy with my swap. 35 to 40 minutes later he told me that he cannot swap my decoders for whatever reasons, I do not work for DStv so I wouldnt fully understand their system or laguage, but he gave me the new decoder and told me that once he was done doing the swap he will let me switch on TV. Around 17h00 he gave me a call to say he has send an email to their head office for escalation as he is still getting an error when trying to do my swap. The very same Saturday night around 20h30 I called Dstv and I was on the fone for 2 hours almost, they just couldn't help me. Mind you now it's day 2 without TV having 4 kids in the house, it was frustrating. On Sunday, I made a call again to DStv and was given a refe number and was told the escalation would take about 3 hours to be resolved, till now it's not.  After 12 midday I got a call from Themba who told me to come to the walk in centre in Mondoer, I went there, waited and guess what? I could not bring the decoder home as they could not load packages in the new decoder. I asked for the old decoder back and I was told it would never work as they have already move my packages. So I went back home frustrated, no decoder, no TV, 4 rascals want their cartoons but Multichoice just does not care. If Multichoice had a competitor, I would immediately move my account. I then called DStv around 20h30 to follow up on my reference number that I was told would take 3 hours to resolve, guess what? No interaction has been made at the time when I followed up, they wanted to log another case which I refused because it seems like they are just logging calls and not follow up on them. Today it's Monday, I still do no have my decoder, I have 4 kids that are frustrated in the house and moreover, I will be paying for all these days that I have not been ****** watching this Dstv. I am unfairly treated and no one is saying anything, this was as simple as doing a swap, why all the delays. I need answers and I need them today!!!!!	0	0	0	1	0	0
387	/dstv-multichoice/reviews/bad-customer-services-2355790	Bad customer services The experience I had with Charmaine at dstv when I called the Durban call centre was appalling. She didn't listen to my query effectively and only when u started to get angry then she understood what I wanted to do. Most of the time she spoke over me and I was really disgusted by the services u received from this agent. I had to shout in order to get her to stop talking so that I could get my query sorted out. I hang up hopefully to get through to another agent as she was not helpful. I wanted to update to dstv premium and she said that I would be pro rata from now till the 7th and I would need for the days used till the 7th she didn't advise me on how to pay until my sister who over heard the conversation asked to ask her if we could pay at pick n pay. She was not at all helpful in advising me on how to pay. Her attitude was terrible by far the worse experience that I have had with dstv and I have been a loyal customer for many years now and the way I was treated was not fair.	0	1	0	0	0	0

I specifically asked the agent who was doing everything with me how much will be due at the end of the month and I was told 594 and I called again to find out how much was due from a different agent and was told the same amount only to check the account now that it's all of a sudden 1500 . Today I speak to itumeleng who tells me that it's company procedure to pro- rata 3 times more than the amount when one has just been active for no less than a month . I've been experiencing issues ever since the price lock and bad service from DSTV .

I sense that the software updates they do on these decoder is breaking some of the decoders. My decoder was playing well then a message saying 'We are verifying your account details pop up on my decoder. When it disappeared i started to have signal issues. I phone they call centre and some of their agent are so lazy to troubleshoot . They told me my decoder is faulty. Took the decoder to Multichoice office and i was told the decoder is fine. Went back home connected the decoder and it played no issues. Then i realised some of the channels are missing. Phone them for more troubleshooting and still the issue cannot be resolved. Now they telling me its my connection that was not even touched by no one. This morning my neighbour calls me to tell me she is having the same problem at her house. Mind you her decoder is new. This is such a bad product and Multichoice does not take ownership and they keep shifting the blame. This is not right at all. I am very upset with their service and bad call centre staff attitude.

Also i changed from dual view to single view. The system updated scheduled the change for thr 1 Dec 2017 and thr new payment amount changed to R365. Which was paid. Today i received an sms informing me that i have an outstanding amount due of R248. When i logged onto my account it showed that i was still on the Compact Plus package. I called you call centre and spoke to Pumlani,  querying my account payment as well as the package. I asked her to investigate as to why the package was changed to compact plus again and call me back. To which she said sorry nobody can call you back you must email your enquiry to us. Surely if a client request further investigation as well as a call back it is possible. I want my package update to Compact as of the 1 Dec 2017 as requested via self service and not as per the 1 Jan 2018 as was done via your call centre.

I spoke to Gugu on 0861 101 099 at Multichoice who gave me the number for an installer 072 1516179 , I called this number serveral times and he promised he will come to install the dish . I gave him my address on 3 different occasions and each time I phoned him he did not know who I was and I had to start the whole procedure again . On few occasions I spoke to him he told me he was asleep and babalaas and his workers are also drunk and will not make it to come out . This is unbelievable and shocking , I am waiting for over a month now with nothing done , I spoke to him yesterday and he said he will come around 6pm to install the dish but he never came . I tried calling him several times afterwards ut he does not answer my calls .	0	0	0	1	0	0

404	/dstv-multichoice/reviews/bad-service-137908437-2023790	BAD SERVICE Let me start by saying I have been busy with DSTV (Multichoice) since early Feb. It started when my friend advised us about the price lock offer as we are currently paying that, he advise us good deal as you get a new PVR decoder no additional charge. I called since early Feb and by mid March still no reply, eventually I got a call manage to switch decoder from my name to husband name but they juts can't get it right. I paid R841 on the 21st of March and account finally got switch on the 24th/03 we requested that the credit on my acc be trf to his account as this will balance out until the next instalment. Well it the 21/04 and still not fix. We have been deactivated at least twice a week since the switch due to non-payment but the credit is laying in my account and no trf of funds was done as requested. We have again be deactivated and reason non-payment. The other problem they telling me that a credit of R500 will be refunded how can it cost you R340  for 4 days on previous contract.  I asked for a breakdown of bill but still waiting. Clearly a rip off. I have done numerous calls logged a lot of complaints on client service website but no one has called me back or responded.	1	0	1	1	1	1

406	/dstv-multichoice/reviews/bad-service-137908444-2023943	Bad Service I called the call centre on the 20th of March and requested an upgrade from compact to premium. The agent I spoke to confirmed with me that there is no payment to be made. I advised her my debit date is the 28th, and she confirmed that no Mrs Le Fleur you don't need to make a payment. Only amount due would be R799 on the 28th. I still asked are you sure? and she reassured me. So when I go and make a payment an amount of R880 reflects, I call the call centre again and the agent spoke to the manager on duty who confirmed a reversal would be done as the error was theirs. I then called on the 9th of April and still the matter has not been resolved. Instead the fool I spoke to tells me the R80 reversal went to my pvr functions. I clearly told him that the R799 I was told to pay was for everything. Dstv is going to the dogs and at this rate I would rather get Netflix at R200 a month than pay almost R900 and still get robbed. It was not my error it was the agents and she should be liable for it not me. Train your staff correctly and stop hiring incompetent people. My matter was escalated on the 9th and still no response to date. 	1	1	1	1	0	0
407	/dstv-multichoice/reviews/bad-service-137908447-2024158	BAD SERVICE According to ITC and Experian, I owe money to Mutlichoice.  But, when I phone Multichoice, I am told my account is in credit.  I asked Multichoice to update it with ITC and Experian, but they cannot put me through to the Finance depart.  They can only E-mail them.  I CAN ALSO E-MAIL AND HAVE DONE THAT, BUT THEY DO NOT RSESPOND TO MY E-MAIL.  I want to buy a car, and the bank tells me that I will not be able to get finance unless Multichoice updates ITC and Experian.  Multichoice now tell me I have to wait 30 days!! So, now I cannot work, because I don't have a car.  And I will probably phone after a month to hear that they have not done ANYTHING.  I don't know what to do now.	1	0	0	1	0	0

I sent proof of payment to DSTV face book page and they told me that they will send it to the finance department and they sent me a message saying  they received my proof of payment and services were reconnected.

414	/dstv-multichoice/reviews/bad-service-2341515	Bad Service To whom it may concern,  DSTV Case no.:  **********   DSTV CEO say that their company’s mission is to : “MultiChoice mission is to always strive towards providing a service of world class standards, and thus your recent unsatisfactory experience is regarded with all seriousness.”  HE failed his above mission completely &  broke all CPA laws.  It's now  2 years and they haven't bodered to take my unsatisfactory experience seriously. They just ignore your complaints, never come back to you, just say pay on a sms or we hand you over to their debt collectors.  IT all started when I have contacted DSTV a few times in June 2015 but without any luck I could not get through, then I emailed them on the 30th of June 2015 @ 08:34 to cancel my services with immediate effect due to I was not in need to make use of their service anymore . Without any feedback from DSTV they just ignored my cancellation and went on keeping their line/service open and expected me to pay for that after i have cancelled  and asked them to close my account. As a customer it's my right to suspend my services at any time and only pay for services that I take up with the service provider. So if I ask you to suspend my services I do not want you to continue with your servises. According to the CPA law a customer can cancel their services with a provider at any time if they cannot afford their services anymore. I have done so and still DSTV kept the services open after I told them to suspend their services.   On the 09 September 2015 my case with DSTV was still not resolved and hasn’t received any communication from them. Then on the 20 October 2016, a Year and 4 Months later DSTV sent me a SMS telling me that they haven’t receive payment, please make payment or we will hand you over to external collections… Is this what you call world class service, threatening me with a sms after a year & 4 months, without calling me or sending me an email to resolve my case and this is illegal to inform me via sms that you are going to hand me over to external collections . This is how DSTV roll, they ignore complaints and not resolving them by just ACCEPTING you owe them this money and you better pay otherwise we hand you over.  Where did I accept that I owe You (dstv) this money, if you decide to continue with your service after I cancelled it with immediate effect?  On the 9th of November 2016 I send DSTV a email (received a auto reply that they did receive my mail and will get back to me) requesting the CEO of DSTV to contact me so that I can take him/her on about the mission statement above, but till this day dstv ignored me again. This morning a lady phoned me and claimed that she's from a external collection company, but no company name was provide and just said that she phone on behalf of multi choice and would like to know when will I pay... I said to her you must be joking, after two years and you still don't want to resolve my matter and expecting me to pay you for something that I've cancelled.    You are breaking the law big time DSTV. I do not owe you a cent!   DSTV Ref. no.:  **********  07/07/2015 DSTV Ref. no.:  **********  08/09/2015  Unhappy ex DSTV customer, Johan Claassen	0	0	1	1	0	1
415	/dstv-multichoice/reviews/bad-service-2353540	Bad Service Phoned 26 Aug 2017 to cancell and consultant convinced me to take the R99 package. He confirmed that showmax can be viewed on any packaged. I phoned again on 24 Sep 2017 to confirm that the downgrade was done and it was confirmed. On 27 Sep 2017 the full premium  was debited from my bank account. I phoned to find out why the full amount R1014 was debited and requested to be refunded immediately as it in not my fault but Dstv. The supervisor said that the refund can only be done within 14 days which i mentioned is not acceptable. I request the refund to me made asap. Then when i requested what the amount would be that will be refunded he said only +-R700 i requested why. He then told me that  you cannot watch showmax if you dont have the premium package. I requested him why i was told it can be done, no response, he dropped the caIl. Phoned again requesting to speak to him again and was told i cannot speak to him, she will send him an email to phone me back. I requested her name and she said Glenda, when i asked her for her surname i was told she is not comfortable giving me her surname then she dropped the phone in my ear. I request that the refund be paid tomorrow with the full installment amount of R909. Should the not be done i will instruct the bank the reverse the debit as dstv had no authority to deduct such amount.	0	1	1	1	0	1

No one is assisting they just tell that the money is not reflecting.   Surprisingly the PayU consultant did send query to the DSTV manager but no response, meaning I paid for nothing!

When arrive at home I've also received a mail from Dstv informing me to call their call center to informing them to ensure I do not got billed twice for the month. I've then checked on Dstv website for an installer. I've phoned  them and they confirmed that they will install the decoder on Tuesday. Wow everything so smooth........ Then I phoned Dstv call center to inform them about the explora 2 decoder, Off is my signal for both HD PVR and 9110 Extra view decoder. I again phoned informing then that it is off and please restore to my original settings as the installer will only install the explora on Tuesday, 10 min later one tv do have a signal but they can not connect both but will escalate to the business department as they have more access to the system to rectify. Saturday morning again not signal phone again, again more than 10 min later all of a sudden the other tv do have signal but the second one not and yes you guess correctly they must again escalate the matter. Sunday morning again not signal both tv's. Phoned again with out any assistance till not no services. BUT SURELY AT THE END OF THE MONTH I WILL BE BILLED THE FULL AMOUNT.

423	/dstv-multichoice/reviews/bad-service-2375176	BAD SERVICE Dstv and thier incompetence and bad service!  It regrets me to say this but clearly the incompetence at Multichoice grows far and wide.  I am so sad to say that after a glitch with my debit orders last month on the 1st my dstv was disconnected I was away on a work trip and when I returned I immediately called DSTV to pay via EFT and reconnect  my dstv. THIS WAS DONE ON THE 14TH OCTOBER AND EMAIL PROOF OF PAYMENT WAS SENT! Its embarrassing enough to have a debit order not go through but to have to be humiliated by explaining the situation every week to ANOTHER agent is just not called for. Its humiliating and the agents are never the same person ypu dealt with so they never know whats going on.  Case number  **********  Reference  ********** 6 I was billed R50 again after paying on the 24th October I was billed again today 29th October R50 All ontop of the initial R923.26 which included my subscription and supposed reconnection fees. But as You can see ive been since charged even more reconnection fees. So everyrime some very competant and thoughtful multichoice employee disconnects my dstv and then acts like they're doing me a favour. Like today switching it on for the day cost me ANOTHER R50 and the agent had the audacity to tell me It will be switched off tomorrow again because this was just for today! The cheek!  Sadly every week since dstv has taken it apoun themselves to switch my tv off at their liberty when they feel like and this has happenned at least 4 TIMES this month. Today AGAIN.  And I have been billed R50 EVERY TIME to switch my dstv on. My monthly bill is usually around the R800 mark but this month it EXCEEDS R1000 because DSTV  thinks this is OK and thinks its fine to overcharge and connects and disconnect viewers and then their agents are not helpful and nobody can find records of payments. It costs me my phonecall money and extra costs o. My bills not to mention the tedious time on the phone with their agents who can't seem to do their basic job description!  I am now going to escalete the issue as im very displeased and I'LL be taking this to a social platform as its now costing me my precious time.  And money and im tired of speaking to different agents everytime I call in to resolve a simple matter.  Please look up your records and see that the payment was made as well as proof sent to you for this. And adjust my accounts accordinly and please remove the unauthorised reconnection fees everytime your incompetent staff switch off and then supposedly reconnect my ALREADY paid for service.   This is totally unacceptable and actually like stealing from your subscribers!  I'm hoping that this review will get me the due service I am paying for and bot recieving!	0	1	0	0	1	0

Now am struggling with adding insurance for my decoder, every time i call am being told they will get an agent to call me back which never happens.

I want my insurance to be cancelled.  My account was supposed to be paid on the 25th but unfortunately was Christmas and I went to Gugulethu mall the next day, only to find them off line,  went to Vanguard mall and same thing,  went to Phillipi mall also offline. Today my account has been disconnected,  this Kelebogile lady now has the decency to tell me that there are many ways to pay my account.  Who's  fault is it if the branches were of line? I spent lots of money going around looking for the branch were I can pay my account and this Kelebogile also wasted my airtime.  Please cancel my insurance	0	1	0	0	1	0

I have been paying every month without statements for the last 6 months.  Calling the call centre is like nearly getting nowhere and emailing them to ask for statements are worse.

438	/dstv-multichoice/reviews/bad-service-2417284	Bad service On the 21st of December I called the dstv call centre in Cape town to upgrade my current package.I explained to the agent that I am on a price lock package and she told me that they will have to call me back,So I was expecting a call back within 48 to 72 hrs. On the 27th I called the centre again as they did not respond to my initial request,The agent was very suprised  to hear that I havnt received a call back as yet and said that they are probably in a backlog,but she has escalated to her supervisor/manager and they will call be back that same day. At 20:45 that evening I was still waiting on a call back and I called them again,was just told again that she has escalated again and that I should rather call back in the morning,because that will give them sufficient time to return my call. I called the next morning just after 8:00 on the 28th of December,I am still waiting on a call back. I do understand that there is public holidays etc. But really now,after several escalations,I still did not get a call back,so my question is,how do u guys prioritize?? I am not even interested anymore in upgrading my package,just want to finnish my contract then I will rather go another route.I am really dissapointed in the service I received and will never recommend anyone to sign up with them.	0	0	1	1	0	0

I checked my transunion credit report on the 03 January 2018 and to my surprise the account (  ********** 5) is again reflecting  as an open account against my name on the credit report.I called multichoice and spoke to a consultant named Tshepiso who pretended not to hear me.

I've people complaining, and I also had problems with them before but now it is getting out of hand. I paid the premium today then suddenly at about 22h45 they suspended my dish while we were still watching a movie. When I used *120*68584# to check what am I owing the message was * you have unused credit of 656......and cents and it also noted my subscription is suspended. No wonder people are unsubscribing.

441	/dstv-multichoice/reviews/bad-service-2420021	Bad service I upgraded to the premium package on the 31/12/2017. My debit order ran on the 2/1/2018. We have been watching the premium channel since then. Today my premium package was cancelled, apparently due to non payment. No one contacted, sms or emailed me regarding this. The person at the call center who I spoke to, to upgrade my package also did not mention that I need to pay a difference from my initial package to the premium package. I was under the impression that I will be billed at the end of the month. Firstly I spoke to a lady for half an hour at the call center who had no idea what she was doing. Not once did she offer to contact me back, I eventually put the phone down as she was wasting my time and airtime. Secondly when I phoned again I spoke to a Khabelo Dhlamini who has no idea what customer service is. After telling me the same story 4 times I had enough. If I had been told that an amount was due on the 31/12/2017 I would of paid it. Why was my debit order not adjusted accordingly, why due to their mistake did they not try and resolve the matter.	0	1	0	0	1	1

There is apparently a system error that would be fixed within 3 hours. That was Saturday morning. I have phoned 8 times since then, on the phone for more than 30 minutes at a time and every time the agent just says they are working on it. Some even “forgot” to escalate my query or to send the correct details. Others would have phoned me back. At least I did not hold my breath, because obviously no one phoned me back. How long can it take to fix something small like this???  Seriously DSTV!!! And for convenience sake my reference number is SD  **********  which was only given to me after the 3rd time I phoned.

I called the centre and spoke to Nominee Mtsweni. She asked for the proof of payment and I sent it. She responded to have received it via email. The next week, I could not record or do catch up. I called again  **********  and I had a quarrel with a very defensive consultant and he ultimately enabled the recording functionality. He attested the proof of payment was on their system. Today, 21.01.2018, I still cannot record again and this is negligence as I am a paying customer. Why is this happening? Are you losing your credibility as a Company? Should I utilise and expose this to social networks? I feel this is disrespecting a customer and I feel It's time we told the rest of the world what a bad service DSTV PROVIDES to paying customers.

I had to watch channel 100 for 2 days with no communication from dstv as to what is the matter.   I called and requested for it to be canceled seeing that no one is resolving the matter nor calling me to update.   Siphamandla Macina was meant to call, he never called. Nqubelo promises that he will escalate the problem and requested that the change of ownership is done during the day when I am not at home. He told me it takes 30 minutes to do it.

447	/dstv-multichoice/reviews/bad-service-2435484	BAD SERVICE 7th January 2018, we decided to upgrade from Premium account, to a Explorer with price lock option including installation. Did the app on line and the following day, personally went to the walk in centre in Sandburg to drop off ID and 3 month bank statements as requested. The walk in centre took docs, scanned and loaded onto system and was assured all is in order and decoder would be despatched in due course. Since the 9th of January, I have phoned on numerous occasions to trying find out progress on delivery of my decoder. On Friday I was assured that my decoder would be delivered by Monday 29 January 2018. Today 30th January 2018 and I am none the wiser. Again phoned call centre and no one can assist me or a advise when my decoder will be delivered.  I was under the impression that Multichoice/DSTV was a world class company with service levels to match but I cannot begin to voice my disappointment with this experience. Please can somebody/anybody advise when I can expect delivery of my decoder!	0	0	0	1	0	0
448	/dstv-multichoice/reviews/bad-service-2439042	Bad Service Good Day,  I am very unhappy with the service from DSTV thus far. I did a change of ownership on 13th January 2018 onto my name and the nett credit was transferred accordingly.   I am now sitting with a situation where I've spoken to about 6-7 consultants on call and via the live chat and no one can seem to fix my pay now functionality. My payment will be due within the next few days and I am unable to see the pay now screen on the dstv site. I have de-linked and re-linked my customer ID to my online profile but still no luck. The cache and browser history on my internet browser has also been cleared. I have wasted to much time and  airtime emailing  and calling DSTV. I have also written to a consultant (with signature LJM) on the Facebook chat for a week and I was advised to send an email to  **********  It has been eight days post sending an email to the before mentioned emailed address and still no feedback. This makes be doubt the competence of the DSTV staff I have dealt with thus far and the customer service levels that are in place.  I am on the premium package, and having to pay this monthly subscription is not worth it - if I'm getting this sort of service or perhaps I should say the lack thereof. It is unacceptable and unprofessional to say the least.  Could this matter please be escalated to a management level and I hope to received feedback soonest.

449	/dstv-multichoice/reviews/bad-service-2439604	Bad service I have been a loyal paying customer with direct debit orders always deducted on time. Below is how they 1) fail to change my banking details after 3 attempts and then 2) disconnect my service after my years of ontime payments and the fault of DSTV.  1) I enter the walk in centre 27 December for a different technical related issue, then I ask at the same time please note that I am downgrading to compact so that my debit order is less come Jan debit order. The agent assured me it has been diarised on the system. I then call in on 12 Jan well ahead of time to ask if this has been done, both the downgrade as well as give my new bank details to make sure that the debit order comes from my New Fnb account as the Nedbank account will be closed. Then I am assured that it is all in order for my next reduced debit order. What happens, my debit does not go off the FNB account, it goes off my Nedbank account forcing it open and charging me unpaid fees not of my fault.I am now harrassed by Nedbank for being overdrawn because of this. I then call DSTV again on 28 Jan and I am told the system was not downgraded and the details were not changed. I then confirm again the new bank details and I am told the system, is now downgraded that I must pay in the compact amount which I have done on 31 Jan 2018 from Fnb for R514.50,   2)This morning my service is disconnected, I call again today 5 Feb and the agent says the bank name says Nedbank which tells me that it was not changed so at the end of Feb I would have had the exact same problem. He says it is now done, I hope so. Then he cannot see my payment, then about my suspension he says 2 days sla for feedback. Seriously????????????? 2 days, I want feedback today, I want to be reconnected TODAY. THIS WAS MULTICHOICE FAULT FOR DEDUCTING THE INCORRECT ACCOUNT CAUSING ME AN INCONVENIENCE,I MADE AN EFT PAYMENT A WEEK AGO.  I am still waiting for feedback from 31 Jan that I was promised, I am still waiting I asked for a manager to call me this morning and still waiting. I want my service reconnected ASAP and my account sorted ASAP, find my payment and correct the account I do not owe you for premium, so whatever is owed by me you will have to write off, actually for good faith you should credit my account for this inconvenience of me having to pay for unpaid charges as well.  You are very quick to take monies  and disconnect services not checking your customer's profile to see they are regular loyal customers, when you owe money or have done wrong then we have to wait and be inconvenience, The service you have provided me over this last few weeks have been atrocious, pathetic.	0	0	1	0	1	0

Therefore, R90 (Box Office and Insurance) is due on 26 Jan. Then 26 Feb R475 is due. I confirmed this info over and over on that call. I was on hole for 13 mins while tge consultant and supervisor checked this info and was assured its correct.  Then a week later i get an sms to pay R530.  I call in again and get told that i actually owe R1300,  but the system is offline so I have to call back.  I call back and then get told that my debit order was actually R495.

460	/dstv-multichoice/reviews/bad-service-2463181	Bad Service I would like to complain about the service delivery experienced from DStv . I had a PVR decoder which started giving me problem. I was then advised by DStv that i should bring it in as they have discontinued PVR's. I went to their offices in Randburg and was given the Explora decoder which i qualified for due to the insurance cover.I then advised the consultant that was assisting that  i would need another channel as the PVR had this functionality.  The consultant then advised me that i would have to buy a extra decoder of which i bought two. I asked if this would be a problem with installation and was told that this was covered by my insurance and installation was free. I was then advised that a technician would call me to make arrangements for the installation. When i was at their offices i did advise the consultant that there is no one at home in the week and this will have to be done over the weekend. I was assured that all was fine and i should wait for my call. the technician called me on Friday to make arrangements and he assured me that he will be there at 11:00. I agreed explaining to him that my helper would be there as i had family commitments on that day.  The day of the installation my helper who advises me that he still has not arrived and this is 12:00. I call him to find out where he is he then advised me that the installation he was working on in the morning too longer than what was expected.  Understandably so these things do happen. I then follow up with my helper to find out if everything has been installed and she advises me that the technician only arrived at 17:30  which is unacceptable.  My helper was waiting for him the whole day and this is on her way out that he arrives. I don't think that this is fair and unacceptable on every level. I then get a call from him stating that he is going to charge me R800 for the installation of the 2 decoder. This was never explained to me when i got them from Multi Choice that this would be an additional charge. I am beyond irritated by this technician with him arriving late with no apology or giving me a headsup that he is still running late and to add to this he still wants to charge me for a service that was explained to me would be free. My helper had to leave so i advised him to excuse himself and not do the installation as there is nobody at home. He then calls DStv to complain about this to ensure that he covers his tracks. I call to report this and i was advised that they will call me back on Monday to sort this out.  Monday came and went and there was no call from DStv or any apology. I then call them on Wednesday to find out what is happening i can't seem to get any answers - only feedback was that they are sorry about the bad service and that the installation of the DStv is at my cost and a technician can charge whatever rate that suites them. Please tell me what service is that - there is no standard rate of the installation. This is a thumb suc****!.  I was also advised that  a technician will call me to make arrangements. It is no Friday and there has not been not one call from DStv. Two at the end of the month i will be addressing another complaint  due to the extra channel that i have that is not being utilised due to Explora that is not installed to give me access to the extra view.   I would like to understand is the way a customer is handled by DStv and what are the measures taken to ensure that one is not subject to this unacceptable service.	0	0	1	0	0	1

464	/dstv-multichoice/reviews/bad-service-2472702	BAD SERVICE!!!!! I am very upset with the service from Multichoice. We paid for our account on the 27th of February only to be disconnected on the 10th of March. We called in and spoke to Thanduxolo Mame who then requested we send through proof of payment, we did as instructed and the service was reconnected. Seven days later we were disconnected AGAIN which happened four more times with seven day intervals. Mind you all this time we are calling back requesting to be reconnected and they see the POP and the document has been sent to the billing department  and everything has been sorted as we had inserted a reference that was one digit short. This morning we were disconnected once again and called in the consultant was not helpful at all. Requested if we could speak to a Supervisor or Manager on duty and we were told they were out on training. To our surprise 5minutes later a Service Warrior by the name of Mfanafuthi Msimango called and told us the only two reason this could be happening is 1. System Error or 2. WE REVERSED THE EFT!  I mean after the pain of calling the customer care where in the world does have energy to do that knowing very well they have reversed the transaction. We then asked to send our Bank Statement because now they want to check the reversal we have made. I mean system errors happen everywhere and we also take responsibility for the incorrect information provided on the reference. It can not possibly take 5 different Consultants and a Service Warrior to fix this!

472	/dstv-multichoice/reviews/bad-service-2499665	Bad Service I would like to complain about the level of service I have received from your online chat agents. I mistakenly paid my DSTV twice this month and immediately I logged into the chat and spoke with Mbali Ramathe who advised me to send in my Copy ID, Proof of paymeng and my 3 months bank statement to her work email which is  **********  unfortunately my connection got disconnected while she was telling me the turn around time of 7-14working days for me to get the refund. The refund amount is initially R500 and was paid cash to a Multichoice branch. I then proceeded to log back online and had a chat with Maria I think I did not get her last name but she also requested same documents and advised to send them to  **********  I became sceptical about that email address after I received an automated response stating that it is for allocating payments and she also advised a turn around time of 7working days only. After receiving the automated email I then logged back into the online chat and chat with Paseka who advised that my documentations were received by Mbali and she is busy processing the refund. This whole happened on the 2nd of May 2018.   Today I decided to do a follow up on the refund I logged back into the same online chat and this time I chat with Doris who basically asked me for all the information i already submitted and she was actually very slow with responding and I was frustrated I ended up requesting for a call centre number. I called in and spoke to a lovely lady named Palesa unfortunately i did not get her last name, she had to redo the whole process as the refund was not processed by all the agents I dealt with on the online chat. She advises that the money with be deposited within 24-48hrs in my bank, now my concern is the turn around time on this matter and I need surety that the refund has been actioned... she gave me a ref number for the call but with all the misleading i have lost faith on Multichoice, I will be posting this on hellopeter if i do not get any response from you guys within 24-48hrs... And I want to know which agents mislead me thinking i am stupid.	0	1	0	1	0	0

494	/dstv-multichoice/reviews/bad-service-2576312	Bad service Yazi. I've been on the phone with multi choice for the past 45 to an hour. I have never in my life experience such poor service. After a guy cut the call on me another lady told me my account was due since February.  I have a debit order with multi choice but seemingly every month I have to call them to remind them to debit my account.  They told me I owe them R436 if I am not mistaken only for them to debit R155 on the 28th of August 2018. After the lady I spoke to told me she can't debut my account because it's after hours bank are closed but she goes and not debit the whole amount of R436 but aR155, without my knowledge. A day later they then debit my account again with an amounth of R436 . I then reverse the amount of R155 because it was taken without my authority. Today they decide to disconnect my service for what reason no one can tell me. Apparently the other one's system is not work and the other guy can not hear me and dropped the call on me. How rude and incompetent.  This is by far the worse service I've received in my life. The government needs to find competition for multi choice because their services is sad (for lack of a better word)	1	1	0	0	1	0

I have a error message saying my package doesn't allow me to catch up whereas I'm paying for catch up and extra view, call center is unable to assist and instead suggest I must drive to their office and have them check my decoder. I honestly can afford a router with what I'm paying DSTV. I stated my case and the consultant was in a rush to say goodbye??? After failing to resolve my error, really!!!	0	1	0	0	0	0

501	/dstv-multichoice/reviews/bad-service-2594233	Bad service So today they switch off my DSTV and tell me that I am R600+ in arrears with DSTV. Then they tell me since April the fees have gone up. I have not recieved any notification of this via sms nor e-mail. When we confirmed details the e-mail adress was put in incorrect with the number 0 as a alphabet number O. Whenever i do not pay they switch DSTV off. Now they say they continued viewing until a period off time on account which i never gave permission to do. Despite all the phone calls ive made during the past two months not one consultant mentioned anything about this arrears amount that apparently was adding up since April 2018. I am very unhappy. I also made a payment of R387 which is more than half of what I owe they still want the full payment and wouldn't settle for me to pay the rest at the end of the month. I count this as really bad service and I am seriously considering to not have DSTV anymore. If they communicated to me about the fees and what would happen if they didnt switch it off. I am really dissapointed and never have recieved such bad service from DSTV! In future I will not recommend this to anyone.	0	0	0	0	1	1

505	/dstv-multichoice/reviews/bad-service-2608417	Bad Service It has been 2 months and my 10th  complaint and my billing issue has not been resolved by Multichoice and the problem was started by their third party which is on Air TV and now I’m  expected to pay,R179.00 which I don’t have a clue where is it coming because according me I am up to date with my account , and I was even up to date before my Explorer got broken, And Within 2 months I am calling Multichoice after every 6 days with no fail , and when you tell their agents they don’t have a clue what is going on!!!! And they promise you that the problem will be fixed. I think at Multichoice there is no proper system where they put notes on system, because their Agents seemed to be confused all the time. Can someone rectify my account am not owing anything at Multichoice, can you please fix my billing and give me a peace of mind. I think I need to take Multichoice and on Air TV to the media and tell everyone how INCOMPETENT they are!	1	1	0	1	0	1
506	/dstv-multichoice/reviews/bad-service-2608918	Bad service I paid my subscription on the 27th September for the month of October then on the 7th I was disconnected and I called on the 8th October and I was asked for the proof of payment which I supplied and was reconnected, then after 3 days I was disconnected again and I called again and sent my pop again and it seems every 3 days I have to call in order to enjoy my dstv subscription. Then Ilogged a complaint and I received a call and was told my acc is sitting with finance to allocate my payment but till Today as we speak I'm disconnected and I must pay R857 to be reconnected. Spoke to some stupid supervisor who said she's gonna look into my acc and get back to me in 15 mins and it's been an hour waiting for a call back.

523	/dstv-multichoice/reviews/bad-service-2674557	Bad service!!!!! Yet again I am left with a problem with my DStv. I called to upgrade and it was done. While on the phone I told the service advisor to schedule my down grade for the second. Today I called to enquire why my DStv was on premium package. The agent (Anserley) tried to assist me in down grading my services back to compact. After a few mins both my main TV and extra view TV were off. After a few minutes he advised me that he needed to speak to his supervisor. He then put me on hold for 18minutes. With my own airtime. He then came back onto the phone and advised me that his supervisor escalated the matter to the technical department. The total duration of the call was 19 mins 44 seconds. Two hours later I am without DStv which I have paid for plus my airtime will not be refunded. No one at DStv has called me to advise me on what is going on with my account. How much longer it will take. Nothing!!! DStv service stinks that is why most of the people are leaving DStv. We pay so much to watch repeats and old movies. Call centre agents are unethical and inexperienced and your service stinks. You don't even give reference numbers for call. So everytime I  call in I have to explain my situation over and over again. Every other company calls back but not DStv. You guys are a complete rip off. I will be cancelling my membership! I want my money paid for this month to be refunded!  Really disappointing!!! 24 hours later. I have not been contacted by a single person from Dstv telling me what is happening with my account. Do they even care about their customers?? I think not. They still lie and say that they tried to contact me. Bad service!!!	0	1	1	0	1	0

526	/dstv-multichoice/reviews/bad-service-2675659	Bad service. I recieved an sms telling met that my account is in arrears with R1100 because my debit order bounced. I never set a debit order in the first place. I made a payment on the 25th of January 2019. I called the customer care centre they said to me that they see the payment on the 25th and on the 27th a debit order went off and was reversed. My account is still in arrears with R1100 and I know for sure that I was up to date before the time because a month or two ago I had to pay close to R1500 to have my account reconnected. This was pro-rata which they explained to me that was charged to me when I do a late payment they charge me for the days I still have picture. I feel robbed and since I have spoken to two different agents the problem was not corrected and I am pretty sure that they will disconnect our viewing soon. I am very dissapointed with DSTV we have been customers for 5+ years and the service seems to deteriate by the day. We have never had any problems since now and its extremely inconvenient.	1	0	0	0	0	1

When I got to work I phoned them and I spoke to a Nokuthula Nkosi who asked me to send her the POP which I did. When I got home my TV was reconnected and I made the assumption that everything has been sorted. To my surprise again this morning my service has been disconnected again due to the same reason. I called and was told that the person I previously spoke to did not attach my payment to my account I must please resend the POP again.

537	/dstv-multichoice/reviews/bad-service-2704172	Bad service Good evening..  At 20:00 pm 17 March I called in because my second decoder was giving an error waiting for primary decoder for connection. I was assist by a woman named Zandile Mhlongo call ref  ********** 0i68. I got the most unpleasant service from DStv, she kept telling me to press an option that was not reflecting on my screen. She was constantly speaking over me as I tried to explain to her that it was not showing on my screen. She then just told me in a very rude manner to hold as she does not understand my decoder. A few seconds after she spoke to another agent, assuming they told her what she didn't know. She just then told me again very rudely that she's putting me through to explore.. Could not say anything because she said that and immediately put me through. I held on the other line till I got cut.. At the end of the night I was not assisted and got the most ****ty service..

538	/dstv-multichoice/reviews/bad-service-2704816	Bad Service I am so angry and disappointed with the service given to me today. I didn't not receive the service I deserve for a person who works for the money, pays a subscription and gets treat like trash. On the 11th of March I made a payment based on the Enquiry I made on how much I needed to pay for my services to be up, which after the agent told me I made the payment. Friday the 15th my services gets suspended and I'm told they don't have payment from me which is not true so there and than I emailed my proof of payment and the agent at that time activated my services. Then come Monday the 18th again my services gets suspended based on the same issue that took place on Friday the 15th. Spoke to an agent who's polite as she gave me the right email address to email my proof of payment because the previous agent on Friday gave me wrong and misleading information. Te the lady told me I should email the documents but then again she gave me the wrong ewail address because my documents did not go through  till  this moment. I asked for the supervisor who also failed to give solution to my problem of having my services up and running again but insisted I pay extra outstanding amount which was short, and honestly I will not do that. My frustration here is that I've been mislead by three people in that same department, which brings question to what kinder of training do they follow and if they know the product, secondly my kids are frustrated cause now they can't watch their favourite programs and now I'm left to look like a failure to them cause one minute it's working the next it's not. This is totally unacceptable and demand asnwers and the right service I believe as a tax payer and South African citizen deserves. This is nonsense and I will not tolerate it.	0	0	0	0	1	0

540	/dstv-multichoice/reviews/bad-service-2709669	Bad service Good day   I am so dissapointed with the consultant who has just assisted me over the phone  on  ********** 061 around 14:29 , 2019/03/27.  The reason  for my call was just for her to tell me the status of my price lock contract, and the way she answered me was as if I am bothering her.   I just asked for a simple  answer if  my application has been approved  or still pending due to documents needed but the way she was talking to me was absolutely unacceptable.  She even dropped the call on me ,and I was not even shouting and arguing with her.   I asked for her name and  her name is Hlengiwe Mthethwa. But kindly listen to the call received around the time 14:29 .   I am committing myself to a 2 year contract with multichoice and if this is the kind of service that I should expect from the company then I guess I might be making a big mistake . But to be honest this is the first time being disrespected by an employee at multichoice and hope its tha last time as shes not applying to any company values .	0	1	0	0	0	0

I called multichoice sometime last month, to find out why my subscription is low, they advised me to pay R423 as I was on  the compku subscription, then when I checked my balance today 05/04/19 my balance shows R616 and I called why is it stating such an amount and they advised me that my account is on arrears with R87, then I asked how come as my account was paid in  full and the gentleman blamed it on the system and I advised him to get me his supervisor and he said her supervisor is not on board and I asked her to get me any supervisor and he put me on hold for a long time and my airtime was exhausted..... I am very angry at how multichoice does things as I have been loyal to them for so long..... Now why is this happening??	1	0	0	0	0	1

So on the 11th I connected my decoder in JHB and a bedit order of R305.77 went of my account which I understand and is correct. The 16th I get a SMS to say that my account has been suspended I need to pay another R279 I phone customer care and I was told to pay R159 because the put the amount outstanding for my box office in that amount so I pay the amount of R159 and straight away get a message to say it's not enough I still need to pay R143. Now before this amount i have already paid R464.77 for my compact package of R399 my dstv is still suspended.  If this is not sorted I will be cancelling all my subscriptions.	0	0	0	0	1	1

Frriday morning I was disconnected again and the answer I got when I called to enquire was just absurd. I was told that because I changed the date I was supposed the pay the prorated fee, this does not make sense because I moved the date down not up. And the consultant says there is nothing she can do about itI have to pay that proeated fee and reconnection again. This is totally absurd. 	1	0	0	0	1	1

553	/dstv-multichoice/reviews/bad-service-4194-1953698	Bad Service  On 5 Dec 2015 I called multichoice & spoke to Thabang. I requested that our dstv be suspended for some time since there was a robbery at home and the television was stolen. I was informed by Thabang that he would put the request to be effected from the 1st of January 2016 since we had already started the month of Dec 2015. So I then assumed that the suspension was effected. On Friday 29 January I was shocked to get a message stating that I need to pay R152 before 30 January with reference number  ********** 6. I wrote to Multichoice requesting an explanation why I am being requested to pay more money as I am under the impression that my service was suspended. Bernard indicated that i was supposed to submit an affidavit with a case number. How was I supposed to know that i need to submit an affidavit when Thabang never informed me of the requirement? And why am I still being billed for a service that I thought has already been suspended as from 1 January 2016? (this means that they took the extra funds that was already in my account as i normally pay more). I am disgusted by the service from multichoice. Maybe its time to look for another service provider as the service is unacceptable	0	0	0	0	0	1

Now I'm sitting with a tv that is not working....I'm so livid with the individual that chose to disconnect my phone for no reason. I held on for more than 10 minutes.....this is just so upsetting to the highest extreme. I wish that someone with brains will call me back and get this sorted out .

I phoned the call centre, the decoder is on a 24 month contract so technically I am still paying it off. I spoke to an agent I could barely understand as he was speaking so unclear. told him what happened, he told me that the warrantee on the decoder expired on 5/2/2016. and that I should have taken out insurance. this was the first time I actually heard anything about insurance. I was told to take it to an agent and that they will not have anything to do with the matter even though I am paying it off and technically still belongs to DSTV. we went to Edenvale on Saturday with no better service than the call centre they did not even want to look at it, we then went to Benoni after about an hour in the queue we were helped. this morning the DSTV is off. E16-4 error. phoned the cc the lady first told me I am behind on my payment when I asked her what payment she responded 22/2/2016 this is today and I pay by debit order????? then she kept me on the phone for at least 20min I had to get my daughter on my cel as they cannot make outgoing calls. did everything she told us still nothing.

559	/dstv-multichoice/reviews/bad-service-4598-1983917	Bad service On Friday 2016-03-04 at approximately 21:15 I called the customer care line. I called for the 4'th time in a week. I spoke to Ms. Mbali Mhlanga ans explained to her that I was frustrated and unhappy because It was my 4'th call in one week to Multichoice to sort out a problem. Every Time I try to rent a movie from box office, I dont receive the movie! It costs me money to sms every time! Then I have to call the call centre for them to rent out the movie to me! It is costing me money to sms, the cost of the movie and phoning the callcentre to rectify the problem! After explaining to Ms. Mhlanga my problem and that I felt unsatisfied that my problem was not sorted out, she raised her voice to me and told me that it is \not the customer care centre agents fault and implied that I am \snippy\ towards her. I am glad that the phone call has been recorded and I sincerely hope that whoever listens to the recording. Why is my problem not receiving any attention? Why is it necessary for me to call the call centre every time? If this doesn't get sorted out soon, I will end my subscription to DSTV immediately.	0	1	0	1	0	0

I previously requested a debit order to pay for my services & December I decided to pay via EFT an amount of R574, on the 10th they suspended my services. I phone them asking the reason & they said it was a technical error, & my services were reseted & all was well. Today the 15th they suspend my services, I checked my balance on the app it shows that I am owing  R228.16 which is due by 24th Jan. My question is why suspend my service if I am not owing is it a technical problem again, why can’t they do this right from the start. Almost everyone in South Africa have DSTV, that means they can’t manage their customer. Just wish there would be one company that can render a better service I would join immediately and live this madness. Just because they have huge number of customers still doesn’t give them the right to take advantage of them	0	0	0	1	1	0

I did ask the gentlemen to confirm amount I will need to pay at the end of the month and he said R475.00 for my explora which I expected to pay on the 25/12/2018, he never mentioned anything having to pay the prorate for the two days I joined DSTV and paying upfront for the additional fees.  2.i was told my account is overdue while I paid already on the 23/11/2018, it is totally unacceptable to spend my own money calling in for something you did not control in house, I mean when you say on the phone sorry for the inconvenience, who is going to reimburse me for the money I spent calling in.  3. it is totally unacceptable when we call in to complain and you ask to be called back, you told it is not possible meaning I have to buy more airtime to complain about your service.  4. last thing, I cannot call in to complain , ask to speak to the manager or team leader and I am being told they all busy they cannot talk to me, really?  what kind of a service is that, that is nonsense really.	1	0	0	0	0	1
577	/dstv-multichoice/reviews/bad-service-and-lack-of-competence-2455986	Bad service and lack of competence I am very irritated right now and serious losing my patience.  I have requested previously this to be escalated to (Team Leader) Martha Khumalo, TL Manqoba Masango and TL Xolani Sithole. I trusted that they would act in the best interest of the client but little did I know. This instruction was totally ignored.  I have just had a discussion with TL Thozamile and he gave me a full breakdown on the billing on my account. Mind you, when I called on the 5th Jan 2018, I was advised at the end of that call that I have a credit balance of R664.   I have been literally calling your contact centre for the past 3 weeks almost every second day to have this issue resolved. Everytime I spoke to someone at your contact centre, they didn’t resolve the issue but instead reconnect me. I want to know who is liable for all these reconnection fees? Please see below with my journey and collection of reconnection fees:  Reconnection Fee R50 05 Jan (The reason I was given here was that I put through a request on the self-service Dstv now to terminate services.. . .what a joke. Found out today that this was untrue but didn’t waiver the reconnection fee. Requested this to be escalated Reconnection Fee R50 08 Feb – I requested clarity and wanted this escalated as to date no one came back to me with a response and there was a payment of R450 not reflecting. Reconnection Fee R50 13 Feb – This is has been resolve and was awaiting feedback. Reconnection Fee R50 23 Feb - This is has been resolve and was awaiting feedback.  Now, my kids can watch TV due someone’s incompetence and I still need to pay for this service? Really??  Please urgently provide feedback and I need this resolved ASAP!	1	0	0	1	1	0
578	/dstv-multichoice/reviews/bad-service-at-multichoice-dstv-2661106	Bad service at multichoice dstv I am highly dissapointed at the service i recieved.on Thursday i spoke to two of their agents which both advised me on the balance on my mother's subscription and i paid and we were reconnected.today i wake up and we were disconnected, i then picked up a phone and called Multichoice to find out what the problem might be and to my surprise boom we have an outstanding balance. Between Thursday and today what changed? Why was i not told about this balance im being told about today? Why ddnt the first two agents see it?i mean they went as far as reconnecting? This is the reason why we stopped using dstv Multichoice last year!i thought it that this is the new year and the service would have improved. Multichoice im angry and furious this is not professional at all.	1	0	0	0	1	1
579	/dstv-multichoice/reviews/bad-service-no-accountability-1973779	Bad Service & no accountability  I contacted DSTV on 01/01/2016 with the intention of upgrading from Compact to Premium. I spoke to a guy who advised that if I upgrade I will only be able to downgrade on the debit order date. I said to him I will rather not upgrade because I am not home during the course of the week.  In the first week of February I received my bank statement and noticed that an amount of R 799 was debited from my account, I contacted DSTV and spoke to a lady who advised that my services were charged to premium and when I asked on \whose instructions\ she mentioned that there was a downgrade done on 19/01/2016 and an upgrade done on the same day (kindly note that i did not call DSTV on the 19th). The lady advised that she will refer the matter to her manager and i was on hold for a couple of minutes she came advising that they will downgrade my services and there will be a credit of R 399.00 on my account. I asked if the same amount can be refunded to my account and she advised that they will keep the aforementioned amount, the debit order for the month of February will not run. To my surprise, my account was debited with an amount of 234.00. Please refund my money.  	1	0	0	0	0	1

Since then It has increased to R849.  I called a couple of times and tried to sort it but everyone keeps telling me it's a department they can't transfer me to and that's where it ends. I've just seen on my statement that you have taken R878 from my account now. What on earth is happening. This was supposed to be a fixed amount for 2years at R799. Promises of no annual increases.

583	/dstv-multichoice/reviews/being-punished-for-dstvs-system-failure-2607855	Being punished for Dstv's system failure In May 2018 we downgraded from a premium package to compac plus because the premium was just too high, we could no longer afford it. Then in September 2018 Multichoice sent me an sms and informed me of a special thy have whixh entails the following: a special running on their Premium package for only R699 from 1-31 Oct.  Our payment for compact plus is always due on the 30th of each and every month, we always pay on the 25th of every month hence we were up to date or he month of September. They upgraded me on the 29th of September and told me to pay R200 for those extra 2 days in Sep.  Then the third week in Oct i received an sms that i owe R360. I contacted them and they told me they can see i paid the R200 however their system did not upgrade me to the special they were running but to the normal premium you pay of R899 hence their system was showing that i was in arrears. Which is not the case  because i did not sign up for R899. They explained to me they can see i signed up for the R699 special but the system has not been updated so i had to pay another R120 which i did  on the 20th of Oct. Then on the 24th of Oct days later my dstv was cut agian. I called and i asked to speak to a manager. I spoke which a guy name Kgomotoso an he told me its a system error which in their capacity could not rectify or bypass and that i had to pay another R175 so that when the system was finally fixed they would credit me the money i've paud.  I refused to pay anymore money for their system failure. To this day their system  did not upgrade me to the Oct special and today they disconnected me again!  As if im the one thats to blame for their incompetence.  How does it take you an entire month to downgrade me to the correct package?  Now i reveived an sms that i have to pay a whopping R1045! How is that even possible?  I want this matter esalated immediately and i want the money i've paid credited to my account. My account number is  ********** 7.	1	0	0	0	1	1

585	/dstv-multichoice/reviews/billed-for-no-service-11-2015396	Billed for no service! I signed up for a new service on the special offer of no increase for 2 years. I told the Sales Person I am moving into a new property in the due course of April so the service should not be activated before installation has taken place.  I send multiple emails which were confirm that it has been sent to their DPP department who will deal with it.  I never received confirmation that they should not bill me, as they can see and know my services are not active for this contract.  However as I feared they debited my account last night with R1 200!  So what should I do about this,  Many years ago I experienced that Multichoice has this habit of debiting your account just as they want with any amount that pleases them, I actually feared this would reoccur with my new contract, and so it did!  I want to cancel everything as I have no confidence in bloodsucking institutions who steals from you!!! 	1	0	0	0	0	1
586	/dstv-multichoice/reviews/billed-for-not-using-the-service-1977809	Billed for not using the service Last year I moved off of your debit order as I wished to use the service when I wanted to and be able to get disconnected if there was a month I didn't want to pay. In November I was moving down to Cape Town and hence decided not to make a payment in order to get disconnected, until we were settled in, I was to resume making a payment in December and get connected again (hence the R50 reconnection fee you charge!!!!). However now an amount of R389.50 gets added to my bill this month because you gave me a \grace\ period in November and only disconnected me half way through the month. I did not want DSTV in November (that's why I didn't make a payment). And I am most certainly not going to pay over R1100 to get DSTV this month. So either you rectify my account or you will lose me as a customer going forward. I don't care if its in your terms and conditions, show me where I signed this by the way, its simple if I want DSTV I pay for it, if I don't disconnect me. You're emails even state make payment by 1st or get disconnect, its your problem if you only realise 2 weeks later that I didn't make a payment. You can't bill me for the 2 weeks I didn't want your service!!!	1	0	0	0	0	1

588	/dstv-multichoice/reviews/billing-incompetence-2419151	billing incompetence The incompetence at dstv is mind boggling. I bought a new explora 2 in December and  cancelled my insurance on 2 older decoders at the same time. I was given a new monthly premium and was told the last date of being insured was the 27th December. My debit order for December came and went with nothing processed off my account. After more than 16 years of having a debit order I was then told that my name did not match my bank account details so they could not process the debit order???? After more phone calls I finally had the debit order processed. Then today I get an sms saying my services have been suspended due to  an outstanding amount of R62.42 which when queried is due to non payment of my insurance.  Really - trying to do business with dstv is not worth the aggravation.  Go ahead and suspend my services Netflix is a fraction of the cost and easier to manage.	0	0	0	1	1	1
589	/dstv-multichoice/reviews/billing-nightmare-2338703	Billing nightmare Good day Mr Rayner,  As a valued customer of Multichoice now for many years (I took out my first contract in 1998), I am writing to you out of utter desperation, frustration and disgust,  I am literally sitting here crying because I am so angry with your company and the lack of service/feedback received to date.  And I am going to explain to you why...  I was unemployed between January 2017 to middle of March 2017. My DSTV premium went off via debit order on the 25th of each month starting from the 25th of January 2017. I asked for the billing date to be the 25th because that was the date I used to get paid at my previous employer and I assumed would be my salary payment date at my future employer too.  In March 2017 I was fortunate enough to find a new job but unfortunately my salary payment dates were all over the place - let me illustrate it to you: March 2017:  I received my salary for April on the 23rd of March April 2017: I received my salary for May on the 25th of April May 2017: I received my salary for June on the 25th of May June 2017: I received my salary for July on the 26th of June July 2017: I received my salary for August on the 26th of July August 2017: I received my salary for September on the 24th of August As you can see from the above dates, my debit order in June would've been unsuccessful as I only received my salary on the 26th of June.  I received a call from one of your consultants (a lady - unfortunately I never took her name as I was busy driving from work back home) in the Accounts department on 26/06/2017 at around 17:22 from a number  ********** . The call lasted for 4m 36s. The consultant advised me that my debit order was unpaid so I made arrangements to pay it manually. I also asked her to change my account to cash instead of debit order because of the different dates I receive my salary and didn't want a debit order to return on my account as it negatively impacts on my credit score (over and above incurring additional costs). She convinced me to keep my account on debit order but to move my debit order date instead. She advised me that I could make my debit order date any date I choose. We then agreed that I would keep it on debit order and that the next debit order would go off my account on the 1st of August. I confirmed the amount that I would need to pay manually for my July subscription and duly paid R1,154 on the 29th of June.  On the morning of the 25th of July I woke up to find an SMS from FNB stating that my Multichoice premium had been unsuccessful. I was baffled and upset but duly paid the installment manually on the 27th of July.   I phoned the accounts department from my recorded landline at work on the 28th of July to enquire as to what had gone wrong with the debit order date. The consultant I spoke to (gentleman) was rather arrogant when I told him that I had spoken to a consultant on the 26th of June and we agreed on a debit order date of the 1st. He told me there were no notes on the system that such a conversation took place. I asked him to escalate the matter to a manager regarding the call I had on the 26th of June as I wanted feedback as to what had gone wrong (as again my credit score is affected and I have to pay additional fees for a returned debit). I also advised him that I would prefer to rather pay my installments via EFT as the payment date of my salary could pose a problem. At this point I was still civil about the whole matter and didn't even ask for my bank charges to be reversed. He advised me that he had changed my account from debit order to cash and that he would get a manager to contact me regarding the issue around my debit order date. I thought this would be the last of my problems.  On the 29th of July I received an SMS stating that my services had been suspended due to non-payment. Baffled I lodged a formal complaint on your website, explaining everything that had transpired to date. A consultant (black lady) phoned me on 29/07/2017 at around 12:05 from  ********** . The call lasted for 5m 10s. I was advised to ignore the SMS as it pertains to the reversal of the unpaid debit order of the 25th. I again asked for feedback from a manager regarding my query I had lodged the day before. Now I was told there were no notes on the system pertaining to my conversation the previous day, nor any notes pertaining to the conversation that had taken place on the 26th of June but that they will again escalate it to a manager. Again I was promised that I would receive feedback.  On the 7th of August I received another SMS stating that my account is in arrears and that I immediately have to make payment of R410.58 to avoid my services being suspended. Now I am livid as I still haven't received any feedback from DSTV regarding my query that I had lodged on the 28th of July. I phoned the call centre on 07/08/2017 at 18:14. The call lasted for 31m 10s FROM MY CELL PHONE. The lady I spoke to couldn't explain to me why there was a balance of R410.58 due on my account. She advised me regarding a re-connection fee which I refused to pay. She checked the notes and also told me there were no notes on the system pertaining to the conversation I had with a consultant on the 26th of June or the 28th of July!. Shockingly she told me that my account still reflected as a debit order account and not a cash account and that I had changed my banking details on the 30th of July! I suppose you can imagine my frustration levels at that point in time.  She was kind enough to change my account to cash payment. I insisted to speak to a manager regarding the balance of R410.58 and she then transferred me to her supervisor (I didn't take names - my apologies). He also went through the notes and told me the same story - that there are no notes of any call that had taken place on the 26th of June (please see the screenshots I'd taken from my cell phone confirming there had in fact been a call) or the 28th of July. He then also confirmed that someone had changed my billing date from the 25th to the 2nd - hence there was now an outstanding balance of R410.58 due on my account. He couldn't tell me who had changed the billing date. He also informed me that it wouldn't be possible for a debit order to run off on the 1st as Multichoice doesn't have the 1st as a debit order date - only the 27th, 28th, 29th and the 30th. I was advised to pay the outstanding R410.58 by the end of August (for the prorata amount generated due to the change in my billing date which I grudgingly agreed to). This time around I asked for a refund regarding the R100 bank charges I had incurred due to the returned debit order of the 25th of July, to which he replied that only a manager can approve a refund. I then asked for a manager to contact me for feedback regarding my initial query lodged on the 28th of July as well as the refund of the R100 bank charges and was promised that I would receive a call from a manager within 48 hours. Guess what - it never happened. I left the issue - I now admit was my mistake.  So on the 25th of August I paid the outstanding R410.58 manually. On the 26th of August I checked my DSTV Now app to see if the payment reflected. To my surprise the DSTV Now app showed that I still owed R200 odd rand which would be due on the 1st of September! Irrited (and from past experience with your company's call centres) I decided to ignore it for now, assuming that the amount would be corrected/updated once my payment of R410.58 reflects and my installment of R1,154 for September becomes due.  Today I log onto my DSTV Now app to pay the R1,154 installment for my September subscription.  Lo and behold! According to Multichoice I now owe your company R1,993!!!! To clarify - I only have two active decoders (none of them PVR decoders). One decoder has an active Compact bouquet and the second an active Premium bouquet. According to your pricing structure the Premium bouquet is R789 and the Compact bouquet R365.   I am now at a loss of words for the additional R839 difference owing on my account (simple maths: R1993 - R1154).  Why don't I simply cancel my DSTV subscription? Well it's simple Mr Rayner. I am paying a Premium subscription for my unemployed retired in-laws as this is the only form of entertainment they have. I also pay a Compact subscription for my ex sister-in-law's son (18 years old) as DSTV is what keeps him off the streets and drugs. He loves his football and since they've had DSTV he doesn't hang out with the wrong crowd in the streets. So I would like to believe I'm paying DSTV for the greater good. If it weren't for them, believe me, I would have cancelled my subscription in July already.  I have nowhere else to turn to but you. As the CEO of Multichoice, you are my last resort.  I have attached my bank statements (in an email to you directly) dating back to February 2017, screenshot of all the manual payments (EFT) made to DSTV, all of my DSTV statements dating back to April 2017 and then last but not least screenshots of the calls made to DSTV and received (including the elusive/non-existent call on 26/06/2017). I need not point out the additional costs incurred in getting backdated statements from the bank etc.  I am no longer asking for feedback Mr Rayner. I now demand it.  Please do understand if I refuse to deal with or speak to any of your call centre agents or supervisors.  If my query is not resolved soonest, unfortunately my next correspondence relating to this matter will include social media, the newspapers and a lawyer.  I hope we can both find an amicable way of resolving my issues and concerns.	1	0	0	1	0	1
590	/dstv-multichoice/reviews/billing-please-train-your-support-agents-2016943	billing - please train your support agents In March I  paid the DSTV premium for the year 2016. This option allows you to make  payment before the annual increase price is effected at the 2015 price. I called the DSTV first to confirm my payment amount , then again to ensure they received payment and also made a further two calls to make sure that I don't get debited for the month of April as my account should be update and the service adviser confirmed.   But I was debited this month!! and when I called this morning I spoke to a Lady named Yaaba. Yaaba clearly had no idea how to handle my call, she had ask others in her team and when she returned, she told me that I didn't qualify for the annual payment at the 2015 price because I paid on the 30 March and the promotion ended on this day. I asked her to please forward the notice that states this, and she said that only her supervisor can help me. When I asked to speak to her supervisor , she said he was not at work.When I asked for the Supervisors  name,my call was cut.  I called again and this time was helped by a Lady Named Cedisile. She told me that it was a system error on their side and how I can resolve this issue.  Sometimes it just depends on who takes for your call	1	0	0	1	0	1

592	/dstv-multichoice/reviews/billing-troubles-1955629	Billing troubles my problem started when i asked multichoice to connect a Holiday viewing card. MultiChoice has since messed up my accounts. i was connected to premium when i requested compact and i requested them to reverse this as i did not request it. Nokuthula said she will listen to the tapes and come back to me this was early jan already still I am waiting. they have since August taken R1154.93 which equals 108 days and since August to December I did not use 108 days yet I have no Credits.   I have the explora deal where they suppose to deduct R799 only. yet their employees fail to do this. one month is R700 and another nothing and then they double deduct following months. Now they cannot reconcile my account yet they have accountants there.   it is time we had strong competition in our beloved south africa to rescue us from this ambushment by DSTV.	1	0	0	1	0	1

The people at customer service are so rude and arrogant and unfriendly and un professional. Apart from waiting for a hour or more to get through to them  the latest excuse is that they ran out of decoders for the black Friday promo .and that we must just wait till they eventually get stock in. the funny part is that I asked them if they had a similar promo as the black Friday  the lady said yesR809 per month  I asked her which decoder will it be she said the explora 3 with wi-fi .so I asked why cant they supply me with that decoder she  said she cant as those decoders are for the current promo and the decoders for black Friday is out of stock...that does not make sense unless I am dumb.. please tell me on the same day the ran out of decorders  they are still charging me R939.00 per month yet I should be paying R749.00  account  ********** 4	0	0	0	1	0	0

She will now transfer the money for my box office,told me to hold she must call her supervisor, I held on for like 5 minutes and got cut (airtime), called back and then she tells me to hold again, then she tells me they are offline. I must call back. I am frustrated just calling you today I bought like R150 airtime which is finished.The holding on the phone is pathetic and when calling we must first listen to this machine	0	0	0	1	0	0
595	/dstv-multichoice/reviews/box-office-money-still-not-refunded-2395846	Box office Money still not refunded Firstly, I was forced to rate you 1 star even though your service is in the dumpsters, that's how horrible and pathetic the service is from you people. I had transferred money into my Box office account VIA THEIR website which makes use of payu. The money was taken off my account on the two occasions immediately. I called straight away to query why didn't it reflect as my family was waiting to watch a movie that night. Apparently they could not find the funds. This happened again when I tried to rent a movie online.  Long story short,I called multiple times to sort this out after sending countless emails and calls nothing is resolved. I finally received a call from Niven Athmaram who assured me they will contact Payu and get the reference numbers for the payments....that was a week ago!!  I called Payu myself, sent them all my information and was assisted the SAME day on MONDAY. I immediately sent this information to dstv so they can allocate the money back. After sending this information to them, I receive an email asking me for all the information I previously provided 3 WEEKS AGO?? I replied to that email and have since not been contacted.  What the hell is wrong with you people?? Do you'll not know how to handle a simple query and resolve it. Instead I must go back and forth like this for almost a month. Your service is sickening.   The money only amounts to R180 in total, and it is not even about the money. I have been battling with you guys for quite some time and the meantime my family cannot rent a movie due to your incompetency. I have the reference codes for the payment, I expect an email or a call acknowledging this complaint, afterwhich I will forward the reference numbers so that the money can be credited in my account.	0	0	1	1	0	0

The money went off my account, and the screen indicated that the transaction had been successful.   I didn't check my balance until about a month and a half later when I wanted to rent a movie and I've sent communication to Box Office twice through their website, and I have not received any feedback.

Got a confirmation sms that it would be ready in 5 minutes.....10 Minutes later still nothing. Then tried a 2nd and third time with the same results. Next I tried the link in the sms twice....guess what....again no luck with this. Last resort tried phoning the call centre and not once but twice entered my ID and I was told that my ID number is not linked and then call cut-off.....the third time I just kept on the line in the hope that it would transfer me and again the line just dropped. In the hope that for some weird reason the movie might be there the next day......to my sadness it was not.Â Looked at my account and was billed for it, I then phoned the call centre and was told that they could do nothing for me....REALLY?????? So bottom line is I will never use this service again....not even showmax ( it belongs to DSTV anyway) ...good old fashion Video Town rentals....if the movie does not work they will at least refund you or let you pick something else.....REALLY ,REALLY Disappointed	0	0	0	1	0	0

In the last month I have spent over R200 calling to get assistance on my account balance reconnection, I have been spoken to four consultants in a matter of 1 hour  the first - didn't understand me didn't make any sense at all and was not very polite the second - was polite but gave me an incorrect amount to pay, I paid based on the information given came back home called for re-connection the third - extremely arrogant made me lose my temper wish I took her name down cause she is the worst call centre agent I have ever dealt with, eventually i cut the call the fourth - told me I was given the incorrect amount I need to pay R37.00 which I then drove back to the shops paid R40, now I log onto my account and am surprised to see that i now owe R23.10. REALLY  Furthermore to my frustration I now can't change the main decoder because I owe R23.10 which is a fault by multi choice, I am not compensated for travelling nor my airtime so the least you can do is understand my queries and provide me with proper service -  	0	1	0	1	1	0

I first paid a DSTV installer company to come out and have a look. They concluded that the decoder is damaged and that there is no issue with my setup at home(R500). On Saturday (30 Jan) I took my decoder to mchoice office in centurion. After numerous tests I was informed that my decoder is damaged and that I need to buy a recondition decoder(R 600). New decoder was updated and I was told I can just plug it in and within 48 hours dstv catch up and box office will work again. By Tuesday dstv catch was still not working (box office works fine). I phoned multichoice pretoria office. After numerous numerous attempts I was informed that my decoder needs to be replaced.  I informed the consultant that I'm not happy about this but I will go back again on saturday to get the decoder replaced. I also requested that I be refunded for the catch-up service, which I'm paying for but is not working. The consultant couldn't assist. Talk to manager also couldn't assist. Was promised someone will phone me today - no one phoned. I'm not happy with having to go back, but willing to do so. I expect mchoice to also help	0	0	1	1	0	0

Let's not mention the complete disaster with Downton Abby's last series. You advertise this benefit aggressively and then drop the ball.

You are in breach of your  advertising the explora regarding content moving over once aired on your channels. False advertising is unacceptable and criminal. I am going to the consumer protection act regarding this and will also write a letter to the Advertising Standards Bureau regarding your false advertising of the explora catch up. Your constant lies and deceitful replies that your technical department is working on the problem. You have been working on the problem since early last year and have achieved nothing. Your share holders and Executives have nothing to hike your prices on the back of sub standard service provided. One will receive better service from a Spaza shop than getting service from Multichoice. I paid my yearly subscription in April last year which only came into effect in October last year so you had my money claiming interest before the new subscription came in, you had my money for 5 months and yet your service is non existing.

Since I took this matter to help peter in November (after 6 months of trying to cancel the insurance since May of 2015), the only thing that multichoice did was to change the case number.

So after complaining this issue was resolved for a couple of weeks but has now started again. I do not want to hear that it could be signal issue as I was previously told. A signal issue will happen anytime of any day of the week. So please can some one with some common sense explain to me why ONLY on Monday evenings at 21H00 sharp my decoder switches off and reboots?

612	/dstv-multichoice/reviews/costly-irritation-due-to-bad-service-2647912	Costly irritation due to bad service I paid my DSTV on the 8th December by EFT as I always do. DSTV is loaded as a benificiary on my system. During the last 10 days my DSTV has been disconnected 3 times. I have sent Proof of payment twice to Multichoice. Every time the dstv is diconnected there is an additional R50 fee due by me. The staff that I have dealt with when I call are very helpful, however the system is up to ****. Every time the call center reconnects me and escalates my POP to Finance department nothing further happens. I had a chap call me yesterday to say that they have located my payment but I will be cut off again on the 22nd Dec. when I asked the reason he told me that was what I had been quoted. He wanted to have my payments deducted by debit order. Then how do I control DSTV'S mess ups once the money is in their account. My payments always run until the 7th of the month. He also told me that he would get back to me I wish someone with a bit of common sense would call me and sort  out this problem as numerous calls to rectify DSTVS mistakes is a costly nuisance to myself and if it was up to me I would not have the service at all and go the streaming route and use netflix or something.	0	0	0	1	1	0

Payment plan: The amount of R1972 was debited from my account and a refund of R955.28 was scheduled to be put back into my account on the 11th May 2017.Â from the transactions above I had paid for 3 months and only recieved 2 months of service with a pending refund. After the refund took more than the required 7 days to refect in my account. I was advised to do a reversal of the amount debited on the 02 May 2017 and pay the amount of R949 into my DSTV account, of which I complied and actioned.Â on the 15th May 2017 my account refelcts the following.Â Residential Account: Credit of R1904.48 (Owing to me)Payment plan: Arrears of R2124.42 (Owing to DSTV)Difference of: R219.94 (Assuming prorata amount on the payment plan. not yet confirmed from DSTV (Multichoice))Â Now beyond this I have spent a total of 3 hours and 53minutes on calls with dstv agents (of which supplied little help)I have spent R107.28 over my call minutes added to my cellphone contract.I have recieved bounce debit order fees from my back that amount to R230.00 (2 Debit orders)Â So in total DSTV (Multichoice) has costed me in my time and a total of R337.28 of money that I will never see again. All because of DSTV (Multichoice) incompentence.Â I have recieved it in writing via email from one of your supervisor Veronica Manyapelo that I will only be debited R949 on the 02nd June 2017. If this is not the case I will be seeking advice on how to end this disgusting and unprofessional behaviour from one of SA's blue chip companies.Final notes:DSTV (Multichoice) - Sort it out, before I do!You owe me: R337.28I owe you: 219.94 (Assuming prorata amount on the payment plan. not yet confirmed from DSTV (Multichoice))Difference: you owe me: R117.34Someone in the Finance Department should be fired for all this.	1	0	0	1	0	0

Since January i have been struggling with them not debiting my account and then suspending my service. My debit order is supposed to go off on the 28th of each month, however there has been stories when I call to find why they are not debiting... one call centre agent went as far as implying that i did not have money in my bank account which i found to be insulting. I feel that if they cannot deduct the money from my bank account  they should tell me so i can make arrangements to pay cash as calling them and waiting for over 20 minutes just to be told you haven't paid is annoying to say the least.	1	1	0	1	1	0

I tried renting a movie for my son now and i received a SMS saying I owe -R35.00 of which I last rented a movie on the 19 December 2017 after I topped up my account leaving me with a balance of R70.00 as per received sms by DStv. I called DStv to enquire about the balance of money I still have in my account, on discussion with the Consultant she checked and only to find the a finance administrator by the name of (Molatelo Kgole) keeps doing reversals on my account : R70 (12/08/17) R140 (08/07/17) R35 (26/5/2/17) R70 (26/5/2017) all these reversals were done with out my knowledge. The consultant assisting me picked up that (M Kgole) again credited my account on the 23/01/2018 with the R140 and R70 reversaled last year. Why is DStv finance busy reversing and crediting without ones knowledge. Now I can't rent movies because of a selfish person who feels they can inconvenience ourselves by doing as they please with our accounts. I don't owe multi choice, multi choice owes me R70.00 credit on my box office. This is fraudulent DStv  DStv you are starting to be a serious life inconvenience period.......... #BoycotteDSTV	1	0	0	0	0	0
623	/dstv-multichoice/reviews/dis-satisfied-customer-2536876	Dis-Satisfied Customer I was on leave with my family and returned home on the morning of the 2 July 2018 and upon accessing my messages, almost immediately on my phone at the airport, a friendly reminder “popped up” requesting the DSTV Multi Choice payment for July 2018, which I had forgotten to pay, prior to my departure on 17 June 2018.  “In order to” avoid the R50 re-connection “the reminder said” please pay R384.52, of which I paid R385.00 before mid-morning of 2 July 2018, from my Nedbank Account.  Subsequently, my services were terminated this morning of 3 July 2018.  Upon phoning your “Call Centre” the operator asked me to email thru my proof of payment and he would connect me immediately.  He immediately realized for me to be re-connected, an additional fee of R50.00 is required, for which I refused to pay.  I am a man of principal and I adhere to them vehemently.  I refuse to pay for something that I am not responsible for.  Your supervisor was not helpful at all.  “In order to” continue the conversation, she promised to contact me almost immediately after we ended our call, but to no avail.  Personnel like Nicky shouldn’t be holding posts as supervisors as she does not know how to deal with the public at large.  I feel that the services, that certain of your STAFF offers, is atrocious and that they would require further rigorous training in “managerial s****s” for them to deal with the public, in a more civil manner.     I have been a loyal customer since inception an I am totally dis-satisfied with the services rendered by yourselves and would terminate my services from the end of July as soon as you deduct my R50.00 from my payment of R385.00 made to you.	0	0	1	0	1	0

I was phoned on the evening of 23 August by Mali advising me that I am due for an upgrade as the old plan expired on price lock. She then could not complete as the system had problems and would call back 24th. Which she did and everything was finalized on 24. She said there was a difference of R126 which I had to pay and I did pay same time. That evening my decoder was disconnected. I called and they reconnected my extra view. I had to call twice to reconnect extra view. Again called twice to reconnect the compact. Now I had to call for the 5th time. To reconnect and to top it off I get an sms saying I owe R550. After my debit order successfully went of on 25 August and the R126 I had to pay. I am not happy at all. Everytime I have to call using my own airtime. This is seriously poor	0	0	0	1	1	1
630	/dstv-multichoice/reviews/disconnection-of-service-thrice-after-payment-2362547	Disconnection of service thrice after payment I paid my Account on the morning of the 29/09/2017 around 4:30am via an sms link received from Multichoice. On Saturday my service had been disconnected and I immediately called to query that and I was told it was because my payment was not reflecting as yet but nonetheless it was connected after the call.  On the 5th of October I received an sms while at work to say my service was disconnected again I immediately called and spoke to a consultant by the name of Mpumi Modise ( Call Ref  :  ********** 7#I63) and she requested that I email her the proof of payment of payment of which I did and she also asked how I made the payment and I told her via sms. She asked which Ref I used but I told her due to me using the link from Multichoice there was no request to me to enter a Ref. To my understanding because the link had my Customer number I thought the Ref would be automatic as the link had all my details. After a few minutes of investigation on her side she reconnected my service and all was well again.  This morning I wake up wanting to check the Weather forecast and baaaang, My service is disconnected for the 3rd time again. I now took my complaint to the DSTV Facebook page and complained via Messenger and my query was responded to within minutes. I'm again being told that payment was not reflecting and as the service was being disconnected and connected there were R50 charges (x3) but had been removed.   I have been inconvenienced 3 times already WITH payment made and all I get is apologies left right & center. I'm very upset and angry right now.	0	0	0	1	1	1

634	/dstv-multichoice/reviews/disgusted-with-multichoice-and-customer-service-center-2582442	Disgusted with Multichoice and customer service center It 's nothing new when people complain about call centers . I have must admit I  hate communication with call centers because 9 out 10 times service center agents are poorly trained and they lack to large extent sensibility ....it's like talked to trained robot or can't think for themselves and can only answer on what's within their programming . In most cases of service providers call centers they are set up to merely deflect their short comings and  create the illusion  that they are been proactive .  Multi choice call center highlighted what's wrong with call centers and most service providers . We have multi choice/Mnet customers for over 26 years , and  nothing as been more frustrating to us when we call the  multichoice call center for  technical assistance and the service agents we got to communicate with lack the technical know how to assist .   We have a simple set up at our property which 2 HD PVR decoders , one which a primary and one which secondary ( extra view)  . Initially when we had the dual view PVR  and we were  asked to upgrade to HD decoders which we accordingly did , however , we consistently had a problem with communication between primary and secondary decoder which was initially linked by a heartbeat cable . After consistently reporting this problem just over 3 years a multichoice accredited technician when changing our decoders , after consultation with multichoice support center removed the heartbeat cable and they linked our decoders via a virtual link .  Since then we have never had a issue with set up , however , on 12th September 2018 , we were having a problem with recording capabilities of secondary decoder and after contacting call center  and they were unable to resolve problem and determined decoder was problem and as we had unit insured , we were told to send unit into a multichoice  center for testing . Unit was taken on 13th and a refurbished unit was hand over to us . On  connecting this unit at home , we got a E 43 alert and I contacted the call center , my 1st call lasted in excess of 1 hour and 20 minutes , as can be proven by my call logs . The service consultant  firstly instead off trying to resolve problem  or getting a senior service engineer involved  to resolve problem , tried to continously tried to deflect any legal or contractual liability from multichoice ....by saying that the insurance we paid was for hardware and not installation . Secondly she was asked to go through historical call logs , and amusingly enough it was obvious that  she wasn't able to  , and interestingly enough over  conversation with other service engineers on Saturday , multichoice doesn't keep proper logs and notes on faults and complaints. One would think a a entity like Multichoice , would have proper records to improve customer service and on also improve on their services . My 1st  communication on 13 ended unresolved and the consultant trying to convince me that it was not possible for our units to have been operating without a heartbeat cable because their hardware wasn't capable . They insisted if I wanted problem resolved I needed to get a installer out at my cost to install a heartbeat cable and I refused because , I believe it not fair for me to continously bare costs for something that's their fault . Firstly , prior to handing in my faulty decoder,  my setup was working fine with no heartbeat .  I pay insurance for units on my property and it's the legal responsibility or multichoice as the service provider and insurance provider to ensure that I  get the same service , as prior to me  handing over old unit .  Why should I bare cost because they can't keep proper records or  refuse to get a qualified person to rectify problem . My request  for talking to senior person was ignored during this 1st call , but i was told that this problem was escalated to extraview department and someone would contact within 1- 3 hrs . This never happened . 2 hours later I called back to get a update and went through the same drama with different consultant .    We had no service on secondary decoder from 13th and the following day we waited and still no feedback from multichoice or their extra view department . On the 15 th September , my brother spent a few hours with call center with the same poor response and no service or resolution and after asking  to speak to a senior person , the consultant cut call . I had just arrived home at the time and I called the customer service center to lodge complaint because we not getting any resolution , all we were been told was that we need to bare cost for getting a installer out to fit a heart beat cable and what they failed to comprehend or understand was that the heartbeat cable was removed in the 1st place and the decoders was setup without heartbeat cable , by their service engineers to overcome the problems that was been encountered due to heartbeat cable . Can someone honestly tell me they will incur a cost to install a cable which doesn't work properly and would lead to further costs of continously calling out installers.  During this call as well , we were cut off after over a hour . I called call center back and asked for  consultant who were speaking to contact us back and i was told she was emailed to contact us back , but that never happened . % hours later after returning home on the 15 th and seen the problem was yet to be resolved and multichoice didn't call back , I once again called call center , this time the consultant listened and did get her floor manager to come on to the line . We went through everything again , i wasn't surprised by the fact that that a supposedly senior floor manager gave the same response as their call center agents are trained to do .  She also insisted that it was not possible for our units to have been working without a heartbeat , that their hardware wasn't cable off that and at my nerve end , I told her she should actually come along with anyone who actually knows their system to the property and show us were the cable existed on our property for last 3 years . I asked  to be contacted by senior customer complaints officer on evening off 15th , however , it's the 17th of September ...I received no communication from multichoice or customer service and my secondary service is still not active . In fact up to Saturday night , we didn't know if the replacement unit worked . The floor manager broke to link between primary and secondary decoder to show that the secondary decoder worked on it's own .  Once again which ignored my complaint that primary and secondary decoder wasn't working , as they were together before changing secondary decoder .  After all this drama over the few days , it's clear :-  1. multichoice service/technical  center  definitely don't know the capabilities off their hardware and software  2. they manipulative and deceitful  3. customer service is no existent -we  had communication with various consultants and 1 floor manager - you can bet for better common sense and customer care from a tuck shop , than hoping to get any from multichoice  4 . we know have to incur cost for no fault of ours , yet multichoice gets to collect our subscriptions and insurance premiums and operate with minimal responsibility to deliver a efficient service .   If anyone  from multichoice management off any ethical values actually reads this , I challenge multichoice to prove me wrong that our set up was working without a heartbeat.  I will be lodging a complaint with ombudsmen , because i believe it my legal right to insist that my set up be restored , as it was before multichoice changing decoders .   But as a customer , I am disgusted with this organization and it;s high time our government opened the door for competitors to multichoice .	0	1	0	0	0	0

639	/dstv-multichoice/reviews/disgusting-service-2580562	Disgusting service I am sick and tired of DSTV and their lack of interest in servicing customers. I have a compact subscription that gets paid via EFT every month on and around the 25th. 6 days ago the service was cut. upon calling and explaining to more than one customer services consultant it was established that the August payment was not reflecting. I then had to email through proof of payment and not long after was reconnected. Yesterday, 5 days later, the service was cut again. Called customer care and after 25 minutes of sitting on the phone was told that it was cut because of a R70 shortfall from JULY 2017. What rubbish! I have never paid short and am willing to pull payment history to prove this.   I REFUSE to pay the R175 they want to reconnect as I have paid every month in full.

I am paying a week or two in advance and this is an issue???   Customer number  ********** 1.   I want DSTV to look into this and reconnect my service. There was a second decoder linked a while back but it was requested that this be removed. I hope that this is not why services have been cut.  Should this not be resolved quickly, as I have paid my September subscription, I will not leave this here.

Yet, I was cut off on the 10th of Dec. I made a payment on the 15th of November to catch up my account and was reconnected, so at worst I should have to pay again on the 15th of December. I went into the Randburg service centre and asked them to reconnect and they refused, saying I owe them R962.89 - according to their back office system. My latest statement, dated 29 November shows an amount due of R38.80 - NOT YET DUE.  So what they are displaying to the customer in the self-service portal is not what they are telling the customer.

He insisted on assisting which was funny because he was of no assistance at all and kept blaming the problem on me that my subscription was suspended even though I has made payment and was receiving an E-16 error. He eventually transferred me to his manager eventually after I insisted as the call was now unbearably long. I spoke to Nompindumo Ndou and raised my concern that I had signed up for a debit order and to date no debit order has gone off my account. She promised me on that call reference :  ********** 7I48 that the next debit order will go off on the 25/06/2018. today is the 25/06/2018 and no debit order has gone off. I then asked her to send me an e-mail confirming this as I was promised numerous times before that my debit order will go off the next month but never does. She flat out refused to do this and told me she was escalating for a  correspondence department  to send me this letter. I found it strange that she refused to assist me even though I expressed to her my reasons for the distrust in the service or any words from the Multi choice call centre. She could not care any less, even when I told her that her I was not happy with her service as a paying client. To say the least, this is yet another 1 of many broken promises to me from Multi choice as I still am waiting on this mysterious letter. I am extremely disappointed and appalled at the service I have been receiving from your organisation entirely. I would not subscribe to multi choice any longer if you had a competitor.	1	0	0	1	0	0
648	/dstv-multichoice/reviews/dissatisfied-customer-2570980	Dissatisfied Customer Please can you assist, on the 20th I had called to change my DSTV package to Compact plus for two weeks and Lunga telephonically confirm that I will be charged a prorate rate of R115.00 on top of my normal premium. To my surprise Tesday when I attempted to make payment it reflected that I need to pay R660.00 how is this so?  Yesterday i called and I spoke to Tami whom reverted back my account to access and advised that i should make payment of R219 which i did.   To my surprise when I got home the channels had been reduced so in conclusion I payed R119 for one week not for two weeks as per my initial arrangement with Lunga.    I would like proper clarity regarding this???????????????????	0	0	0	0	0	1

651	/dstv-multichoice/reviews/dont-ever-activate-dstv-for-short-periods-2358931	Don't ever activate DSTV for short periods I called the Multichoice call centre on  ********** 222 to find out if there was a way to view the sports channels so my husband could watch the big Boxing fights the end of September. I was told I could activate the premium package until my next payment was due for my Easy Access subscription on the 28th. This meant my husband could watch sport for 10 days. I was assured, 3 times, by the first lady that I would be charged R294.17 pro rata rate for these 10 days. I said would check with my husband first and then call back, which I did. The second lady confirmed that it would cost me R294.17 and this would be deducted from my bank account on Monday, as this was now Saturday. And the service would be deactivated the 30th. Well on the 28th Multichioice deducted R1103.19 from my account. I called to find out why and also that my service was still activated. Well within seconds the channels were cut and since then I am trying to recover R760.02 from them which would be the amount they owe for the difference they took from the R294.17 owing plus now October subscription of R49. Since 28th I have had no joy getting overpayment back. On 29th I spoke to Mandla and was assured that same day they would do refund.  On 2nd Sanile said no takes 7 days.  On 3rd they could not help me as they were offline. Today 4th I went into their offices in Somerset West, Oak Street to be told I was misinformed aboutactivating this service for 10 days. This is not possible they say!???? I then called  ********** 222 to be told by Nkateko that it takes 7-14 days for refund. Does anyone in Multichoice know what they are doing? A friend has just informed me that they had the same problem. So please people don't try and activate for a few days. DSTV Multichoice will take your money. When will I see a refund. What terrible service.	1	0	0	1	0	1

653	/dstv-multichoice/reviews/double-payment-2755196	Double payment  Good day all.  My name is Ntombi Vilakazi I have been with dstv for +-10years now without any hassles.  Paying between the 20th and the 26th of every month an amount of R809.00 for subscription and R35.00 for insurance  which comes up to R844.00. I would have connection for full 30 days as should.  I missed paying end of March and went to pay on the 24th of April at Pick n Pay.  When I got there I was told to pay half of what I usually pay which surprised me.  I paid that amount then called in to be reconnected. On the 5th of May I got disconnected when I contacted dstv I was told I didn't pay the full amount.  I told them that when I went to pay I was told to pay R440.00 so how was I to know what was happening, they told me I would have to pay.  I decided to wait till the 20th to pay to get full coverage.  I paid on the 20th of this month an amount of R880.00 then called in to be reconnected.  Now my issue is that I'm told that I will be disconnected on the 29th. When I ask why I'm told different things. The person I was talking to on the phone says my account has a credit of R394.03 then on the 29th I must call in to change my paying date then I will only pay an amount of R156.00. I then chatted to KBG and MK on messenger.  Now they say my account was had and overdue of R178.60 and the connection fee of R50.00. Then they took those two amounts from this R880.00 which leaves R651.40. Then from that they take R242.70 for subscription between 20/05/2019 to 28/05/2019 which leaves a credit of R394.03. Now I don't understand why the amount paid is getting divided like this were as its never been done before since I took this package. I have paid between the 20th and 26th like I said of every month and I've never had problems. I then decided that they should disconnect me refund what I gave them which is R880 then I'll pay on the 29th.  I was told to send my ID copy and proof of banking details to  **********  which I did.  I'm really upset with dstv and I need this sorted out.	1	0	0	0	1	0

On my to return the decoder I  was involved in a car accident lost the slip on the process and DSTV handed me over to debt collectors who want R124.00 from I asked what the amount is for I was told it's for activating the account but how do you active my account cause the decoder is not working all I'm told we are the debt collectors you must pay the account is on your name should you want to active again you must pay a additional fee of R50 . I can't believe  the poor service rendered all they want is money.  I'll take my cash somewhere else where   excellent service is rendered .  Keep away from this guys.	0	0	0	0	0	1

How on earth is one who has never had an explora supposed to know this. Their call centre is useless with no resolution to this.

I wanted to reconnect my services with DSTV, went to the App to check the balance for reconnection and it showed R65 (Pay R65 to reconnect your services).  Then I  clicked Pay-In App, provided my card details and it said successful, waited a few minutes  no re-connection. Called the Call centre I was told I need to pay R197 more, the lady said R65 is impossible, I told her well that's what the App told me to pay, plus I had recently received a Discount SMS from DSTV and it's almost month end so I assumed that's how the R65 was calculated.

Services were never reinstated although we checked for two days and was never called back. got sms19/08 saying services suspended, when i called now they told me i owe the over R1200 for services i never got, every channel on my dstv says services suspended. Dstv is nothing but thugs and skelms who take our money without giving us services - this is the 3rd time we get billed by dstv but they cant explain - earlier this year we were told they credited my account with R700 cause i made a double payment - not one agent could provide me proof of the double payment or of the money being paid back to us, two months later were told we owe them R700 - what nonsense is this and we as consumers must just be satisfied with it? the only reason we want dstv is for the sports as we dont watch movies - I once switched off my services for 8 months when we reconnect the same movies were still playing but on a different channel.	1	0	1	1	0	1

I applied for a price lock package with a promise of free installation within 24HR, its been days later and still no installation. After calling numerous times i was given numbers to contact the installers with no success. What disgusts me the most on Saturday 6 Jan a call center agent drop the call in my ear.  Thereafter a manager tried to assist me promising to call on this Monday morning and failed to do so.  I must make mention I will not be paying for a service that i reap no benefit of.

665	/dstv-multichoice/reviews/dstv-bully-tack-ticks-2415808	DSTV Bully tack ticks This is why we need more Pay channel options in S.A!!!!  A loyal DSTV “Premium” customer for over 24 Years. No issues till the launch of the Explorer, I was contacted no more than 7 time by DSTV service providers. They all came with amazing offers to persuade me to migrate from HD PVR to an Explorer. Every time my answer was a firm No! Reason being that I have 2 decoders with dual view, all in perfectly working order. Not to mention all the hidden cost to upgrade to an Explorer, you don’t get told about up front ‘bigger dish, new cable and LNB connections to mention a few”  Then the fun and game started. Decoders re-setting / scanning at random, especially during big sporting events “the only reason I still have DSTV”. Unexplained signal loss and channels disappearing.  My phone calls to the Call Centre started of being subtle but quickly progressed to full blown aggressive threats of cancelation etc. This all in vain, in an effort to receive the service I pay for every month. As it happens more that often with a monopoly, I was ignored and send from pillar to post with all excuses under the sun. I have spent in the region of R1200 replacing cables, LNB connections etc. Then it daunted on me, my refusal to upgrade is now coming home to roost. I spoke to several outlets selling the Explorer product and heard first hand from customer and Sales consultants the same horror stories that I’m currently experiencing. If you don’t upgrade religiously you will run the same gauntlet. Is this not breach of contract, I pay you for a service, and you deliver the service. Typical bully tactics by a monopoly.  I so which Cart Blanche would report on this scandal. O’ but they part of DSTV.  PS. My last call to DSTV was met with a reply “ The Dual view agent will call you back” this was 2 weeks ago!!!!	0	0	1	1	0	0

Once again DSTV cant get their billing right -  I have not had one month where the due amount on the DSTV app / the SMS they send you and the amount due when I call in correlates and is the same.  I have just received a disconnect SMS, but my due date is the 27th.  When I called into the call centre, Ms Busisiwe proceeds to inform me that it is my insurance premium that is in arrears.  Surely you manage that premium and it should be added to the amount you SMS me every month to pay.  I am so sick and tired of going round in circles and I have had issues with billing and DSTV for the past 3 years.  I hope that ICASA approves another Satellite provider so that I can move my services to them. DSTV need to stop whinging to ICASA that Netflix and Showmax are causing job losses they need to get their act together and start servicing the customers who pay big money every month to use their service.

668	/dstv-multichoice/reviews/dstv-cannot-resolve-upgrade-error-2584142	DSTV cannot resolve upgrade Error!! DSTV in breach of contract. DSTV is unable to resolve an error on their side caused by a faulty upgrade which is affecting DSTV subscribers. DSTV cannot provide a reasonable time to resolve this issue in more than 6 days, therefore cannot reasonably expect customers to continue paying for services they do not have. DSTV has been avoiding customers plea to assist in resolving this matter. No formal communication from their PR team or CEO has been published, keeping their customers in the dark. It seems DSTV will continue to ignore it’s customers untill such time that customers refuse to pay for their services and stand together to get DSTV to provide a solution and timelines. DSTV is measuring the % complaints regarding this upgrade error against their current active subscriber base and realised the % of people complaining is so small that it will not hurt them should they lose these subscribers. Their attitude is where will these subscribers go, they do not have a choice but to stay with DSTV. Don’t be surprised if your plea for help is ignored.	0	0	0	1	0	0

672	/dstv-multichoice/reviews/dstv-couldnt-care-less-that-premium-subscription-showmax-does-not-work-2610396	DStv couldn't care less that Premium Subscription Showmax does not work. Even though I am on DStv Prime subscription, my Showmax subscription was terminated.  When I enquired with DStv they told me that it was active on their side and referred me to Showmax.  Showmax informed me that the subscription fee was declined from DStv and kindly offered to give me 7 days grace watching while DStv solved the problem.  The 7 days expired and the Showmax subscription was suspended again. I spent about an hour on the customer service line with an agent who informed me that there was nothing that she could do about it and that I had to fix it via the self-service web portal.  I attempted this but just kept going around in circles with the DStv portal redirecting me to the Showmax portal and then when I tried to re-activate my subscription I was informed that the transaction was declined.  The DStv agent said that there must be something wrong with the site and that I just had to keep on trying until I got it right.  When I informed her that it was the second time in a week that I spent a long time on the telephone and the internet to try and resolve an issue which was due to a problem on their side and that I wanted to speak to a supervisor, I was told that that would not be possible and that I could take it up with Showmax.  When I contacted Showmax they again gave me a seven day grace period.  That was 5 days ago.  I just contacted them again and the issue has still not been resolved.  Showmax informed me that if the service gets terminated again after the 7 days expires that I must just contact them again and they will give me another 7 days grace.  So it appears that the Showmax that DStv advertises as being included in their Premium package must be manually renewed by contacting Showmax every 7 days and DStv could not care less about the inconvenience that this causes for their subscribers.	0	0	0	1	1	0

The consultant then again advised me that she has spoken to her manager who ensured her that a technician would call me back, I have still not received a call back.

Since April we have gone back and forth with DStv and their pathetic service, we were told by a DStv agent in April that its an installation error that has caused our DStv channels to stop broadcasting, since April we have been waiting for DStv to send out technicians/installers to fix the problem, every week we phone and every week we are told a technician will be out and nobody ever shows up! Yet we are still paying for premium package and don't even have all our channels. Our decoder and dish was installed in March and under 6 months warranty, we have been requesting since April for someone to come out and have been told over and over that installers would be out, My partner phoned again a week ago to find out why we are still waiting for installers to come out and fix the issue and the agent now tells us that we have to get installers out at our cost to fix the issue because the installation is not under warranty! DStv are damn skelems! they delayed sending out technicians for months so that they could tell me I have to get it fixed at my cost! I want my installation repaired and I am sick of waiting for DStv employees, technicians and installer  to get off their get off their asses and do their jobs!

I have recently signed up for the premium subscription (explora package deal)  which supposedly includes free installation, internet connectivity etc etc.  They  delivered a faulty /broken internet connector. this was confirmed by the subcontractor  sent for installation. Then when i phoned to say the installation is not completed because they delivered broken parts to me, the multiple operators i spoke to simply said i must return it at my own cost at a branch. They refused to therefore make good on the advertised free delivery and installation. Now since then i have been to two different offices. No one could assist me. once again only phone calls were made to head office which then said i must drive to an another (third) office.  What should have been a hassle free easy switch over to Dstv explora has become a time consuming and laboring task which has offered nothing but frustration.  and still we have no internet connectivity for our explora - only a broken device delivered to me which somehow has now become my problem, all while i am the consumer paying for this non-existing service.	0	0	0	1	0	0

Multichoice must be the only company that won't take an inbound sales call - clearly business is just too easy/profitable/self centric for them.  I have sent multiple SMS's to the numbers advertised by Multichoice and I'm pretty sure that after calling the DSTV call centre a couple of times to query why nobody had responded to these messages, I was actually blessed enough to receive a call on Wednesday from the much promised 0100017858 number. Unfortunately for me, i couldn't answer at the time and missed my opportunity to be of service as a customer - yes I am being ironic.  It would be reasonable to expect that given they know I'm a customer in waiting that an agent might try to call again to secure a guaranteed, two year contracted client? Hell no, that'd almost qualify as delivering a service. Silly idea.

The story started yesterday, i get an sms from multichoice saying i owe R99 for my showmax account.  I go check my dstv now app, and true as nuts it is added on! Ironically i am a premium subscriber, so surely its free as advertised. I call dstv, first operator says i need to call showmax. So I call them, they say no go to DSTV. Getting the run around as usual. I call DSTV again, and get told the call will be escalated. I call today again, and now a new bull**** story, I get told you have to have an explora for the account to be free? Now again I get told that my showmax is not linked to my dstv account, then how does it show on my dstv now app? Trying to speak to a manager is almost impossible.  Now would love someone to sort this out and fix my account before close of business today or i will be cancelling my subscription.   This service is disgusting!  They wonder why I cancelled my debit orders, as they had been overcharging me for months, took ages  to get my refund, now they are making up every excuse possible to extort money from me.	0	0	0	1	0	1

Then I called the call center for them to reconnect me, I was told to provide a trans reference number by the 1st consultant. Then I had to look for the receipt and called back to give them the reference number... Only to be told that I must send the proof of payment via email. I explained to the consultant that I don't have access to email currently and would rather send a watsapp, fax or a mms with the proof of payment attached. The lady told me that none of the above is possible and she can not assist me any further. I then opted to speak to a manager then I was placed on hold until I ran out of airtime which I feel was done deliberately, in order for them to get rid of me. If they really wanted to resolve my query and cared about me as a customer, why hasn't anyone called me back? Really frustrated!!!!!!!!!	0	0	1	0	1	0
698	/dstv-multichoice/reviews/dstv-megatronics-uitenhage-2765661	DSTV Megatronics Uitenhage During November 2018 our DSTV decoder became faulty and we had to replace it. We bought a new decoder from Megatronics in Uitenhage and upon installation the installers opened a 2nd account on my mothers name which we realized after payment was made at the end of November 2018 and our decoder was switched off. We phoned Megatronics and were informed we have 2 accounts and should start paying on the new account which we then started doing. They acknowledged that the second account should never have been opened as my mother is an exciting client for many years. They also informed us of a credit on the old account which will be transferred over to the new account. It has been 7 months and we are still struggling. The credit has not been transferred, and for some reason the new account keeps reflecting an arrears. Megatronics have been provided with proof of payments as well as bank statements. But every month our decoder is switched off due to non-payment. We have even gone as far as paying the arrear amount which was given to us by a Megatronics employee today, after which we received a sms stating that the account is still in arrears. This has been an ongoing struggle between us and the employees at Megatronics and nothing is being resolved as Megatronics are blaming MultiChoice head office. We have made various phone calls to Megatronics as well as went to the business and spoke to them personally.	1	0	0	1	1	1
699	/dstv-multichoice/reviews/dstv-misled-me-2504171	DSTV misled me In April 2018 I went to reconnect my account at Multichoice in Goodwood. I was expecting to pay roughly R5000 but the lady at the counter said I only needed to pay R3000. She then informed me that my next payment date would be in May 2018. I was surprised and i asked her to check if her dates were correct and she confirmed to me that I only need to pay in May. A few days later DSTV disconnected my account. I called them to reconnect the account and they did so and I again asked the lady to re-confirm the next payment date. She told me it was in May 2018. I dialled the DSTV USSD code to confirm the balance owing and it confirmed the same thing I was told also. A few days later I received an SMS from DSTV showing me how much i owed and the due date which was May 2018. All these events occured in April just before my pay date. On the 10th of May 2018 DSTV disconnected my  account and when I call they are telling me that I was suppose to pay in April. Like any other South African I have been affected by the VAT increase and fuel price increase, I no longer have funds to pay my subscription. Pay day is in 2 weeks for me and I must now watch channel 100 only because i was mis-informed by DSTV. I am not a happy customer and I feel disappointed. I am seriously considering ending my relationship with them and use other alternatives. I as your loyal customer did not deserve this treatment DSTV.	1	0	0	0	1	0

Earlier this year, I get a phone call out of the blue saying I have been handed over because I still owe DSTV money. I was totally shocked! I haven’t been with them since 2015? And Jan 2017, we did a change of ownership, which DSTV doesn’t allow if there is outstanding money. So why on earth after all this time, will they say I still owe them money?! I can only think it is because the company is in serious financial trouble. Needless to say, after countless emails back and forth, I still haven’t received any clear answers. Because each and every email I send, someone else answers and NEVER does my questions get answered. I’m sure I’m not the only person DSTV is harassing like this.

After taking a break for over  a year from the tv. I decide to re-activate my dstv account. Since I was away for so long, I decide to call multichoice directly and hear exactly how much I need to pay in order for them to activate my account (this was on 09 December 2018 The lady I spoke to advised me that to activate my account from the 9th Dec until my next payment date 20 January 2019 I need to pay R560 (this includes the subscription, PVR functionalities as well as the R50 reconnection fee).

I decided I will pay tomorrow at Eastgate Mall (since it would be a day later, the amount should go down anyway).  The Following day, 10 December 2018, I make the deposit of R570 which is more than what they said I should pay and I fone multichoice again. I am told my payment has not reflected yet and so I need to send my proof of payment. I email the proof of payment as requested and then the guy told me that he has reconnected me (this was in the afternoon when I was at work)  I get home at 19:30 to check if all is in order but there was no connection. I then phone multichoice AGAIN!!!    I explain to this lady that I’ve paid my required amount why is the connection still not up? And suprise suprise I am told I need to pay R33   Like really???? What the hell is this?   First I’m given an amount to pay, I then pay more than what’s required. Then I’m told I’m connected which I clearly was not and now I need to pay R33???  My problem is not the R33 but rather the messed up service!!  I can’t believe we have to pay so much yet this is the level of of poor service and treatment received in return.

707	/dstv-multichoice/reviews/dstv-multist-2584568	DStv Multis**t There are channels which were fuzzy, and some weren’t playing at all. After calling the Johannesburg call centre, a consultant suggested a “Reset to Factory Default”, and the “Installation Wizard” wouldn’t go beyond step 4 of 5, to scan. Subsequently, the consultant told me that the matter would be escalated – no ref. number given – and that someone would call me with further steps to take to fix the issue. This was around 09H30. It’s 20H10, and nobody has bothered to make contact. Now no channels can be viewed, because it’s stuck at the “Installation Wizard”. This is unacceptable, utter hogwash really! Although this is completely pathetic, I’m glad I’m not the one paying for the service – or lack thereof. You can’t be charging premium prices for rubbish. For as long as DStv keeps giving paying customers lacklustre service, they’ll keep losing customers to the likes of Netflix and Hulu.	0	0	1	1	0	0

My last payment was in March 2018 which settled my account in full.  On the 3rd of May I received an SMS stating that I had stopped paying my account and that I needed to pay R949 to reconnect. As I had cancelled and owed nothing and did not wish to reconnect I ignored the SMS. On the 30 May I received an SMS stating that DSTV had not received payment on my account and that I was to pay R149.83 ??? I contacted DSTV's customer service to enquire what the amount was for and was told that a statement would be emailed to me. I then received a phone call from a DSTV representative who wanted to know why I had cancelled. On the 30th of June I had still not received the statement and now received an SMS from DSTV informing me that they were in the process of using an external collections agency to collect the outstanding amount. I then contacted DSTV customer service again and spoke to Daisy  ref no  ********** -I144. She informed me that I owed the R149.83 due to DSTV providing service for an additional 5 days after the end of the cancellation month. I informed her I never requested this, I never used the service and that i had cancelled. She informed me that they had no record of my cancellation, no record of my first phone call, no record of the representative that had contacted me and that I needed to pay the outstanding amount. I then requested to speak to someone from the billing department and was informed that i would not be able to since they are not allowed to transfer clients to the billing dept and they do not give out the number for the billing dept. She did however promise to request the billing dept send me a statement and confirmed my email address. She also mentioned I could view my account using MY DSTV online. To date I have not received any statement, when trying to view my account online, I login and then receive a message saying I cannot view my account since I am not logged in, even though the page shows my username. So to avoid being blacklisted, I am being forced to pay for something I never requested, something that should never have happened, from a company whose service I dont want, and I cannot communicate with anyone from the company that can say anything except pay us our money or else! So with no other option and to avoid being blacklisted over R149.83 I have been intimidated into paying the money. What an absolute disgrace, my family, friends and everyone I know will never have anything to do with DSTV ever again!	1	0	0	0	0	1

This all happend in July 2018.   Now I get this sms We've still not received payment for your DStv payment plan & have had to update your payment profile with the credit bureau. For where and how to pay, please dial *120*68584#. We've asked a collections agency to get in touch with you regarding the outstanding payment.   I did what I had to, I phoned twice to cancel, 1st time in June around the 16th or so, they said I had to phone back closer to when my contract expires witch was the next month around the 15th so I phoned around the 15th or so of July again.  If your staff can't do there work and your company can't pick up the phone to finde out why I haven't paid this is not my fault.

721	/dstv-multichoice/reviews/dstv-price-lock-is-a-scam-2409865	DSTV Price lock is a scam Last year I signed up for the Explora Price lock deal. What a mess I have gotten myself into. For the past 6 to 8 months I've probably called MultiChoice more than I call my mother and at every call I'm given a new story about my account. I've had large amounts debited from my account without my consent and when I call to complain I'm taken through a long list of so call skipped payments that never seem to get cleared even after these large debits. In many instances I've called them more than once on a day and the versions about the state of my account changes with each call. Then there's the so call Price Lock department that can't take calls for whatever reasons yet they are the ones said to have the accurate answers. I regret the day I signed up for this pyramid scheme.  I've never encountered such thuggery in my life. MultiChoice must take us serious, we have rights as consumers and this country has laws. Honestly, if anyone asked me about taking up this so called offer I would strongly advise against it.	0	0	0	1	0	1
722	/dstv-multichoice/reviews/dstv-price-lock-very-dissapointed-2740273	DSTV PRICE LOCK - VERY DISSAPOINTED!!! From the 26th of April 2019 up until today DSTV has not come back to me with regards to my request that I made on getting Price lock for 899 per month.  I had a 24 month contract on the Price lock package but it expired - So the month of April DSTV cost me R993 - So I was offered the Price Lock package again and that was to be sent to me with the new Explora 3 with  full installation but nothing has been done. I was advised that delivery will be between 5 and 10 days from the 26th of April but until this day I have had nothing but hear that my application is in  the Vetting department.  I have made over 10 calls on different days to DSTV following up - You can check your records. I am highly disappointed as I have been a loyal customer for so many years without ever missing a payment and this is the service that I get given. WHY offer that with Price lock you can save money and then when one reapplies this is the service that I get.  This is a big NO NO fom my side.  Kindly advise what will be done on this matter as I am more than willing to cancel my subscription and use my uncapped Wi-Fi to access other options of watching TV.

After several times of phoning, sending mails to correct the issue with my account its been unsuccessful.   I pay my account every month and dstv keeps on suspending my account. Yesterday after nearly an hour on the phone and sending then mails I tried to solve the issue and this morning the dstv were suspended again.   This is causing problems as my family and the tenants are repeatedly being disrupted. Dstv did not after delivering my explora price log package send out a installer two years ago and I paid everything out of my own pocket. I lodge a complaint and they send a mail to apologize and downgraded my installment as compensation. The also promised to reverse the funds already paid extra to my account.   This never happened and ever since my account have been in a issue phase causing it to be suspended two to three times a month and I have to battle with them connecting it again.	1	0	0	1	1	0

725	/dstv-multichoice/reviews/dstv-promotion-is-a-complete-scam-and-customer-care-service-is-a-sham-2539455	DSTV promotion is a complete scam and customer care service is a sham In February, I signed for the premium special running at the time for R599.  The special was running for two months until end of April.  The message received as a reminder to make the payment was the full amount of the premium package. I followed with a call to enquire if this was a genuine discrepancy, to my surprise I was informed by the call centre agent that I need to pay full amount and then it will be credited, the following month I will pay a smaller amount.  Beginning of March, I paid ~R850, subsequent to that no credit passed and I chose to delay payment for April until I got disconnected as I was dissatisfied with the arrangement. Needless to say, if my account is disconnected there is a fee payable should I elect to reconnect.  Beginning of April, again I paid an amount of ~R730, still no special promotion price. I have followed on the billing numerous times, DSTV customer care is non-existent, my airtime finished on hold, lady retrieving my account and trying reconcile. The team cannot follow up on dropped calls from customer (my contact details are in the system. I call again to follow up, a different agent and to my frustration there is no record of the previous call, matter discussed and reference as to the status of my query.  I phoned beginning of May to follow up again, the lady was quite helpful, did a full recon of my account and advised that I have an outstanding credit for the month of April and March. I should pay R399, can continue with premium if I choose or revert to DSTV Compact. I rush to pay at the spar, the outstanding amount is R499 to my surprise, I pay and discover my PVR is deactivated I then pay R50 to activate a few days later.  I have resigned myself to any solution from the team, the promotion was a complete scam and costed me greatly.   It doesn't end there, beginning of June I made a payment on a Saturday the 2rd of June, eager to watch the SAMA. I get home my decoder is not working, E04- E06 error, the following day a Sunday I got DSTV call centre to log a call to resolve the issue. I spent 30 minutes the lady asking to take my card out, wipe it, put it back in. Switch off the decoder, reboot, take out the cable, connect it back. NOTHING HELPED.  I phone again, 4 days later, with the same error, agent gives me the same instructions as before still no resolution. I could not believe how useless the whole process was, the fact that the DSTV agents are either not trained, just reading a manual and a complete waste of my airtime. To my fury, I hung up on the lady.  My services were off for 18 days, meaning I wasted my money and the fact that DSTV is unable to track usage and active connectivity is an indication of the lack of diligence in ensuring that customers are constantly enjoying the full benefit of the services offered.  My colleague advised that I take the decoder to a multi choice centre nearby, only then I got resolution to my problem where the decoder was replaced.  I was only connected for 10 days and then I receive a hash reminder to pay on the 26th June, now that was the straw that broke the camels back.  And 4 days later, my services were disconnected.  I have since then, connected fibre in my house, Afrihost offers the best, available on whatsapp, most effective customer care and signed up for other platforms like Netflix.  I love my local content, but DSTV has just lost the plot with simply providing the most basic services: correct billing , resolving customer customer query be it technical or account and simply  following on customer query that cannot be resolved on the phone.	0	0	0	1	1	1
726	/dstv-multichoice/reviews/dstv-r899-what-a-rip-off-2022150	DStv R899... what a rip off At the beginning of February I decide to sign up for the R899 explora special. On the 5th February my Explora is delivered and 5 days later it's installed. From day 1 I had problems accessing the premium content. The accredited installer took for visits after the next month to determine that the problem was with the smart LNB that was supplied with my R899 package. So for over a month i had not had the benefit from the service yet i have been billed for the entire month. I have made contact with @DStvcare but to be honest they don't care. I've been given the run around. It took over a week for someone to call me, and when they called they were clueless to my problem. I'm still waiting for them to call me back as they were going to investigate the issue. That was 2 weeks ago.  So today I attempted to do a recon on my account and a see that i was billed R1150 for April on a R899 package. i don't think they know what happening. I'm tired of running around now. i'm forced to take this further.	0	0	1	1	0	1

729	/dstv-multichoice/reviews/dstv-renaging-on-payment-terms-2470007	DSTV renaging on payment terms DSTV sent out an email last month advising of price increases and ways to skip the increase, To pay a year in advance the wording reads Pay a full year's subscription in one payment before 31st March 2018 to take advantage of current prices and get your 12th month on us This I tried to do but was initially informed that could not be done as my billing date is 10th April and I could get a free month AT THE NEW PRICE!  Eventually, after I argued this, the operator then said she would contact me later in the month invoicing me at the old rate but I would lose several day's subs. Not being happy with this I again called today and was informed that I was now on monthly billing! News to me! I again repeated that I wanted to pay a year in advance at the old rate - not possible - escalated to supervisor who could not hear me on a landline - put phone down after over 30 minutes on this call. Tried again with Cape Town number, got a much more alert operator called Sheridan who made a plan, pay the full year's subs into their bank account and then phone again to sort it out. Can't pay on their website as their system only allows you to pay the amount they claim is outstanding...one month! Total time on the phone on 14th and 21st March, around 70 minutes. Staff understanding, either limited or obstructive, customer satisfaction -zero. I still have to resolve this issue, having made the payment, but cannot understand how such a large company can show such a high degree of incompetence in advertising a deal and then NOT honouring it.

This was the balance for and extra month & and R30.00pm payment made in addition. What has annoyed me again is that upon entering my account today via DSTV connect app - the credit balance is showing 1150.00 and then when entering the View my balance screen it shows 1091.00. It looks like having a credit balance with a Large business enterprise is a NO NO.  I still have not received a statement of account showing all the times I have paid extra and for the one month were a full additional subscription was paid.

734	/dstv-multichoice/reviews/dstv-stealing-clients-money-and-selling-damaged-goods-2422617	DSTV STEALING CLIENTS MONEY AND SELLING DAMAGED GOODS I have a complaint against DSTV. The story is as follows:  I had purchased two new HD DSTV single view decoders and a new TV for the December holidays in order for me too have 3 separate DSTV viewings at my house. I had an installer come out and do a re-install at my house at a cost of R4000. DSTV then charged me an additional R85 in addition to paying the normal premium subscription for the full bouquet. The install was done in mid-November 2017. From this date I have had no HD channels on the two new single decoders that were purchased from the DSTV centre in umhlanga. I have had numerous interactions with DSTV and they informed me that it will be escalated and someone will call me.  But no-one has. I’ve been to the service centre in Umhlanga on more than 5 occasions and been getting “sorry” and “we will escalate” this matter but there has been no resolve on the matter.   I have been told it’s a national problem and the guys are working on it. The new decoders are not broadcasting in HD, how is it possible for them to then deduct money from people when they are not providing a service. Its robbery!. Its false advertising by DSTV as their decoders cant broadcast in HD. Ive asked that they change the new decoders but their rude staff seem too don’t care.	0	0	1	1	0	0
735	/dstv-multichoice/reviews/dstv-stealing-my-money-2637937	DStv stealing my money DStv stole a week of viewship from me. I paid my monthly subscription early on the 12th (it was due on the 14th), but magically it expired on the 7th. I had numerous conversations with them but they insisted on NOT honoring what I had paid for.  In addition, I reported that my second decorder was not working. I had paid my subs including the US$11/ month for the extraview (I paid for two months). Instead of crediting my account with money paid for a service that I had reported to them that I couldn't access, I was made to jump through hoops by being asked to offer explanations in numerous emails and then was assured that if I put it in writing my account would be credited with these funds.  It wasn't.   I am deeply disappointed with the fraudulent dealings that I have had to endure from DStv. How can you hold onto money for services that you don't provide and then curtail viewing for a period that I paid for?  Desperation is what has driven me to bring my case onto this forum. I hope that someone at DStv can finally be persuaded to look into this and sort this out.	0	0	0	0	1	0

I have been a faithful DSTV customer for many years, and enjoyed their service.Â A couple of months ago, I took the package of dstv premium with new decoder, for 24 months.Â A few months thereafter, I re-assessed my budget, and wanted to cut back on expenses. I phoned dstv and told them I want to freeze my account for a while. Because I am on the 24-month package, they informed me that I first needed to pay a once-off settlement amount to fulfill that contract, which I did (Although it took my NUMEROUS calls, and being transfered from one wrong department to the next.....)In the end I payed the amount, and the lady confirmed that my account was frozen. However, I still received tv viewing on my account, so I went to the local teletronics shop, where they informed me that it is because I payed ahead - you pay, and then you enjoy watching the rest of the month.Â BUT, the lady phoned in and stopped my account on my behalf, and I cleary remember her instructing them to REMOVE me as a debit order client, that I am now a cash paying client, so that no extra money would go off on my account, (This was 2016 Nov - the above process already started in Sept)Would you believe it, during the month of December, DSTV took ANOTHER payment, via debit order from my account!!! I have phoned in via teletronics, who have phoned in on my behalf via their direct lines, we are in February, AND STILL I HAVE NOT RECEIVED MY MONEY BACK WHICH WAS TAKEN ILLEGALLY FROM MY ACCOUNT!!!!!Â Dstv, what the hell?!?!?!?

As a DSTV customer for many years I was very surprised when I took my faulty decoder to the DSTV shop at Carnival Mall the unit was tested and I was told there is no fault with the unit. It had been freezing and giving me an error message to unplug the unit and restart it. This would happeno up to 3 times a week. So I took hope and the continued on a regular basis. After many calls to the Carnival mall shop and many calls to the call centre. I was informed that I don't have insurance on my decode. I was never offered or advised that insurance in not included in my subscription. I was then told to take my decoder to Benoni car radio to be exchanged and I had to pay R400 in. So off I went to Benoni where I stood in a a for over 25 min only to be told they only have the old type decoder and don't have stock of the HD decoder. I was told to go buy one at Pep or Game which I did. I called your call center AGAIN to activate the new decoder this took over 40 min. And your consultant could not clear an error code that indicated my subscription was being verified. He informed me that it should clear in 10 min. So I waited. Then 20 min later had to call back as the error had not cleared. So we eventually got the decoder working. So I excitedly started watching TV only to find out that I can't select some channels when using the scrolling option. Some channes give me the options to watch or Airing. And I can't select to watch. The options given are Set reminder or Other Airing. The programme I'm trying to select is currently on why can't I select to watch it. Ive called your call centre AGAIN ..... 4 times and this can't be resolved.   I have to ask myself if paying for a premium subcribtion over R700 a month is worth it. How is it that there are not more option available why only DSTV. As an example.... We have numerous cell phone providers..... Multi choice needs some competition maybe then they will improve their service.

748	/dstv-multichoice/reviews/e143-4-horror-2554052	E143-4 HORROR Two weeks ago I purchased a second Explora2 to replace PVR on an Extraview package. I also linked a HD decoder on the same package. That was the beginning of the HORROR EPISODE.  I could not be connected for an unknown reason, I ended up requesting that Multichoice run the three decoders as individual accounts.   On Sunday I replaced the HD decoder with the third Explora2, and requested that the Extraview be activated.  Twelve calls later to the call centre, only one Explora works well, the second cannot record nor rewind, and the third gives E143.  I have been promised a call from Technical department, and I'm still waiting.  Please could someone assist me.	0	0	0	1	0	0

End of July I was billed for another month when I should have been disconnected . To make things worse I was again billed in end of August. I called the customer services dept. 3 different times now, and they told me that it would be sorted and I would be refunded. Well I am still waiting since August. I have been a customer of theirs for over 20 years and this is how I get treated when I decide to disconnect.

Done with DSTV and their billing issues, ‘corporate lies’ driven by monopoly. It’s pathetic that an organisation of Multichoice’s magnitude will advertise a special, send you an SMS and then later refuse to honour their part. DSTV advertised R599/month subscription for premium package and on the basis of this, I upgraded. I was billed full price in Feb 2018 (about R785), complained about the billing and I was advised the query will be submitted to “business desk”. No response received. Same thing happened in March 2018 and today I’ve spent close to 200 minutes on the phone trying to get this either corrected or explained to me but no one at Multichoice cares.  It’s time for these organisations who believe they’re too big for their customers to fall. You may enjoy the monopoly today but it’s only a matter of time before subscribers get service providers who actually care about giving the best and interact positively with their customers. It’s probably R280 that I was over billed but as a matter of principle, I’m done with DSTV. I’ve downgraded to R100 package, activated Netflix and so far so good. Just a matter of time before I cut DSTV out completely. I cannot continue handing out whatever amount of money to an organisation that disrespects me as a customer.	0	0	0	1	0	1

The initial amount to pay for this as I understood would be 899 now imagine my shock when 1370 was deducted from my account on the 7th of march(this is over and above the 446 I had paid just days before).  So today the 8th March I call and hold for hours trying to get to the bottom of the matter and then transferred from person to person only to be told the matter will be escalated(bear in mind this matter has been escalated from Feb when I realized there might be a problem with my account) so today as if taking my money was not enough my services were suspended and besides being on the phone at my expense for an hour or so I was told there was nothing to be done for me but escalate the matter, even 2 team leaders I spoke to today(Khumbulani and Marissa from the DPP department) could not do anything for me but escalate the matter(trust me I'm familiar with the word \escalate\)...

761	/dstv-multichoice/reviews/explora-debacle-1993233	EXPLORA DEBACLE We had a HD PVR unit installed at home. After a long deliberation we decided to upgrade to the Explora option on their R899 p/month offer. BIG MISTAKE. The Explora unit (SC 1035325278, Unit S/No. P600816465) was delivered to our house on 07/03/2106 and installed the next day. Our previous HD PVR (SC 41381795909, Unit S/No P400113389) unit was installed as Extraview in our bedroom. Everything worked perfectly for 2 days and then all went pear shaped.. We kept on getting E16 error message. After numerous calls to the DSTV Call Centre and with the help of the service agent, we managed to get the signal restored. The problem now is that DSTV, have for whatever reason, registered a second Explora unit against my name. And of course their now appears to be an additional monthly charge because of this. We have never owned, purchased or been given a second Explora unit nor have we ever applied for a second DSTV Premium package.  We have sent e-mails to DSTV in this regard but as yet no response (Ref Nos. 7628356,7628357 & 7625196).

762	/dstv-multichoice/reviews/explorer-nightmare-2442685	Explorer nightmare This is the second time I am using hello Peter. I did get reaction last time fro. Dstv which I am grateful for but unfortunately was told that I would be phoned back. I am still waiting for the phone call. We received an explorer on price lock, it has not been installed due to the installer not having adequate suppliers to install. The moment it was delivered we were told the explorer was activated. I immediately  and said that they cannot activate it until it was installed. Dstv said that it would not be activated until it was installed. The installer would activate and on that day I should cancel my pvr.  I have since then been charged for an explorer and a pvr. I happily pay for the pvr but I will not pay for the explorer until it is installed. I am happy to pay once it is installed and will then commence the 24 month contract on price lock. I have had my account for my pvr suspended over and over again only to be reactivated when I speak to a consultant as they see that the pvr is paid up. I have been phoned and told that the explorer service would be credited for. Guess what it hasn't and again my pvr is suspended. I phoned at 18.45 to be told that the pvr was paid in full and  was activated and they again would ask the finance department to call me to sort out before 7pm. Guess what no phone call. 19.10 per suspended again this time when I phone they say it is suspended as everything falls under the same if number so all my products are suspended. So I buy two cars on my I'd. I pay for one and not the other and they take both away. I don't think so. So tonight we have no pvr service even though we pay for this in advance. As far as I am concerned if this matter isn't sorted out by tomorrow dstv can fetch explorer and pvr and I will not use them anymore. This is unacceptable. Expecting me to pay for a service I am.not getting. Not sure how dstv think this is Okay!!	0	0	1	1	1	1

775	/dstv-multichoice/reviews/fraudsters-2604108	Fraudsters So about almost two months ago I decided to take out the explora contract with DSTV thinking that it would be a awesome experience. Well I was completely wrong. . Around end of September, before my debit order date, I decided contact them to verify the amount I'd be charged. To my surprise, the debit order amount was over R3000 and therefore to confirm if this was correct, I decided to contact them. The advisor who assisted me immediately noticed the error and told me to directly pay the correct amount directly at a money market and that they would not debit my account for this month and have this matter escalated in the meantime. I done this, and moved on. On 21 October I decided to contact them to verify the amount I needed to pay and also to confirm if the matter had been addressed seeing that I have not heard anything from the escalations department and also, remembering that they had previously tried to debit my account even after this arrangement had been made. I contacted them on 21 October, and the advisor who assisted me this time told me that I had a amount of R2200 to pay which in the end still sounded incorrect to me. I asked for a break down of the costs and was advised that I had a previous outstanding cost of R100 and odd. I had a pro-rata amount of almost 900 bucks, I had a charge of R49 for the extra decoder I took and according to them. This all amounted to above R2000 as a outstanding amount for October. I am not too sure if this people are able to calculate, if they are just prone to be fraudsters or if they are plan and simple illiterate in any possible way. I then was escalated to a supervisor waste of my time, who then advised that they would send me a statement and I requested that they stay on the line while I wait for the statement and also go through it. The supervisor agreed and transfered me back to the previous advisor who till this day is sending me the statement. I waited for a few minutes and didn't receive anything. I then said I would contact them back as I had already been on a call for over 30 minutes from my cellphone. I eventually called back, requested for a statement to be sent and the next advisor tried her best, which I now do hope was the case, but all of a sudden had system issues and couldn't email the statement to me. Eventually she attempted sending it to me from her manager's PC which after being placed on hold, was unsuccessful. I was once again told they would escalate the matter and I'd be called back in a hour. Well, today is 22 October and no call or statement has been sent. I am truly disgusted by this utter disrespect and dishonestly. I work nightshift, in a call center, 11 hours a shift and 4 days straight and I truly do not have a second to be messed around with. I honestly cannot believe this matter and would like people to please look out, be careful. DSTV is so quick to providing you with a service however have no backbone, they are cheats, and don't give a damn about its customers.	1	0	0	1	0	1

I am beyond ****ed with the service I have received for the past 2 months. the company decided to make an offer of paying for compact subscription then get upgraded after 3 months to a compact plus which I took the deal. then now they forgot to load that on their machines now instead of showing the correct amount of R400 its says R519. But what annoyed me it the fact that after i paid this month they went and debited my account again. I have never given them permission to debit my account. to my surprise now I was debited of R519 which for them to refund me the money will take me a week. I am so tired of calling them because i repeat things to different consultant and they just say yes to everything but they don't fix my problem. What i want to know is who gave them permission to debit my account ever since i had this account i have been paying cash and i have never skipped any payment. if there was another company that offered the same **** I would jump ship instantly but I am stuck with you. Instead of you guys trying to keep the customers you have happy you just making it easier for them to move  to show max or netflix.

Â The 1st Call Centre lady, offered to update my banking details to which I replied that I have not changed these for 15 years, so why in 2017 have other details been aligned to my account? Â She was instructed to reinstate my information plus my DSTV service. Â She did reinstate my service then. Â However, nothing has been done to correct my payment information & records. Â On 8 March, DSTV deducted excess of my normal premium hence 2nd call to DSTV on 14 Mar 2017, the Call Centre lady informed me that the extra monies are due to my account being suspended! Â Nothing had been done to investigate why my bank details were suddently changed in Jan 2017! Â Spoke to a supervisor, on 14 Mar 2017 who promised to investigate & to listen to my previous tel call. Â She would phone me back. Â 17 Mar 2017, having had no call from the supervisor, another Call Centre lady checked on my records confirming that my account was in arears hence the additional debited charge. Â She had no idea who was the previous Supervisor (Pearl) & refused to give me the H/O direct tel no., to speak to a senior accounts manager. Â Said she would send an internal email to my previous Call Centre lady to find out who was the supervisor to whom I was transferred. Â Not allowed to copy me on that email. Â My guess is that somebody, with access to client banking details, is using fraudulent actions & that Multichoice are trying to cover up this fact. Â I am now going to stop my DSTV Debit order & make my own payments.	1	0	1	1	1	1

During Jan one of my smartcards was activated without my consent. After complaining with HP my acc was credited, however I never received the refund. Two weeks ago I called to have my smartcard activated. Was told to pay a full month in advance. When I enquired about the credit of Jan, I was told that a 3rd smartcard was activated! I insisted to speak to a supervisor and after 90min the supervisor did the following to my account:   1. Refund 3rd smartcard that was activated incorrectly  2. Transfer 2nd smartcard to holiday account to avoid confusion.  Have 2 smartcards on holiday account 3. Transfer R759 credit to the holiday account 4. The remaining credit of R790 would go to the residential account. On 11/04 I called and the agent could only pick up 1 credit. I requested to speak to a supervisor and was told that the supervisor would call me back.  The supervisor called me at 23h00! I asked that they should call me the next day and until now has not received any calls.  The accounts division of Multichoice is surely a big MESS Acc Holder: L Erasmus ID: 6703225034084	1	0	0	1	0	0
790	/dstv-multichoice/reviews/horrendous-service-from-multichoice-2551194	HORRENDOUS SERVICE FROM MULTICHOICE!!!!!! I was called by Multichoice with a price lock EXPLORER offer I advised that this is to be in place of my Premium service that I have had for close to 10 years. I was debited on the 26th of June 2018. - On the 14 of July I was disconnected for arrears. I called on Monday the 16th and spoke to a lady that said my Premium service was never cancelled and a 2nd explorer was processed on my name. I informed her this is totally unacceptable and she advised that she is reversing these amounts which totaled to R1500.00 and reconnecting me. Pity I didn't get her name as she blatantly lied to me. - On the 20th of July I was debited with a WHOPPING R2300.00 might be peanuts to DSTV execs but it is a lot to me. I called the same day where your voice prompts said my due amount is R1700!! Clear multichoice accounts, customer care billing are separate entities that do not seem to be affiliated with one another. I spoke to Tsholofelo Ralegoma She advised the reversals were never done and that she will now do them and I will receive a R1491.00 in my account in 3 days (not working days) - This is lie number 2. - the 24th I call AGAIN I speak to Nobuza Mweli she advised that the refund was requested but was rejected by accounts but no reason give. I demand to speak to the team leader.  I speak to Rennie Chand who says that the explorer was never activated on my account.. Imagine my surprise to be debit for 2 explorers but have none active!! He promises to have look into the matter have it sorted and to call me today. - Lie number 3  1. This is HORRENDOUS service. 2. I have a right to kept informed of issues on my account. I have not had 1 call only sms demanding incorrect amounts. 3. I have a right to be heard BUT Multichoice are not listening or following my instructions. 4. I have a right to Redress but I have not received ANY response to my formal complaint lodged the 20/07/18 with Tsholofelo. 5. Multichoice has caused detriment to my account and my livelihood because I had an unplanned R1500.00 missing from my budget as if I do not have two little children and over and above the charges, telephone calls and inconvenience I have endured is appalling.  Multichoice - Enriching lives! .... that a joke and the Biggest False statement of all.  I want my refund and a formal apology TODAY!   BE ASSURED I WILL TELL THIS STORY TO ANYONE WHO WILL LISTEN AND IF MULTICHOICE STILL FAIL TO ACKNOWLEDGE ME.

791	/dstv-multichoice/reviews/horrible-customer-experience-2459839	Horrible customer experience About a month ago, 26 Jan 2018 to be exact, i received a call from Multichoice after showing an interest on PriceLock. The call went well and the agent advised me that my PriceLock was approved and i will receive an SMS/call from couriers to arrange delivery. A week passed and i called Multichoice call centre( ********** 470) and was advised that an escalation will be created and someone will call me back within 24 hours. Another week passed without any call, I then called them back to check if there's any feedback...Nothing, an agent i spoke to said she will escalate the call, AGAIN and someone will call within 72 hours this time around... Another week passed, still no call, i called again....They continue escalting a call until one time i asked to speak to the team lead after getting tired of call being escalated. Team Lead promised to get someone to call me back, nothing...until someone really called me back to start a new application, we tried but she picked an application that was pending...which made sense...she couldnt explain why and she said she will call back later that day, I am still waiting. Last week Friday, I spoke to a different guy(got hold via  ********** ) he promised that someone will call me back that friday or monday and he will call on tuesday to check with me if someone called...Well I am still waiting.  Infact i called and everytime i speak to the agents...they asked me to explain the same things and they promise to do the same thing. I asked for a complaints dept number...I was given this number:  ********** ...unfortunately the number does not exist...very strange that multichoice don't really check their numbers.  BTW i have tried Multichoice Facebook Complaints page and there's no response.  All i want to know from Multichoice is will they ever assist me or not. Is my application approved or declined...seems to be confusing to them.	0	0	1	1	0	0

794	/dstv-multichoice/reviews/how-difficult-is-it-to-refund-to-me-the-credit-on-my-account-2474844	How difficult is it to refund to me the CREDIT on my account? Firstly, I am disgusted with the your customer service. In the past, it used to be quite good. My issue is as follows... My account is currently in credit of about R2000. I would like to have this amount refunded to me. But it seems to be such a big issue to get my own money paid back to me.  On about 12th Mar, I enquired about the process. I was told about docs I needed to send. I got the required documentation and then spoke to Brenton on the 13th of Mar. I sent the required docs to him and he confirmed the refund was processed. I followed up on the 19th, and that agent was unhelpful, saying that I just had to wait for 7 working days. I only wanted her to check that all was still in order. I called back that same week and was told that it was never processed! I called back many times to follow up, and to this date, still NOTHING. Each agents promises to get back to me, which never happens.  I requested this refund early this month, in order for it to be paid back to me in time for month end, for when I really needed it. But with your bad service, it wont be in time! Right now, I cant even expect any decent service from you, and don't want to use your service any longer. I rather would like to cancel my service if that's what it takes and just get back what is owed to me! Can someone please take some responsibility and resolve this issue?? And while you at it, try and resolve your customer service issue as well!  Another thing to note, they requested a bank statement and copy of ID. I sent this. Then they said they also want proof of payment. I said it's on my bank statement (as I pay via EFT), which CLEARLY shows the payment I made AND the customer number. But apparently, that's not good enough? What else am I supposed to do? Reprint and highlight only that part? Seriously guys, some common sense as well. I'm not applying for a bond here. I just want my money back. Thank you.	0	0	0	1	0	0

I had a problem with a faulty batch of LMB receivers, one of which was fitted to my satellite dish and kept loosing signal and channels. Multichoice suggested that it was the installer, but they supply the installer with the hardware. Weeks, and many fights later, once the new LMB was fitted, problem solved. My question to Multichoice was, who takes the responsibility for all the down time, as I paid for a full package (they had no problem taking my money) but for weeks didn't receive the full package. It has been email upon email, phone call upon phone call and nothing. All they do is pass the buck hoping, I guess, that you will get bored and go away. I have been put on hold, phone calls cut off, had my problem escalated (whatever that means) and promised phone calls from supervisors, but nothing. I guess as long as they get their money, why should they bother right. Oddly enough, every time I mentioned not paying they responded, and then \escalated\ my problem. Thanks Multichoice, your valued customer.	0	0	1	1	0	0

I have recently opened an account with them and took the DSTV Explorer price plan package for my fiance who stays in Cape Town while i stay in East London because he didnt qualify so we used my name. He pays the money into my bank account every month on his pay day which is the 15th of every month then Multi choice deducts it from me. I have recently writen a letter to them stating clearly that they should start deducting from his bank account on every 15th of every month from September on wards and have provided all thw necessary documentation with all our signatures and they agreed but until today they haven't. I even wanted to change ownership and that too was a huge deal. The consultants i spoke to arw useless as they never assist me.

I phoned to enquire this error and the conultant confirmed it was indeed multichoices error and i was given the follow 3 options to resolve thisÂ  mess which are by the way more convenient to multichoice than they are for me:1 credit my account with the difference then pay less next month. 2 reverse the full amount then pay the correct amount due in cash which by the way would mean i pay double the bank charges for the same payment. 3 have this matter sent for correction where only the difference would be reverse and this process takes aboutÂ  3 weeks. firstly i work on a budget now the 1st option disrupts it. secondly i set up a debit order to avoid such situations where i would have to pay cash then end up being disconnected because the consultants didnt transfer the funds or be told i have paid and incorrect as i have been told by one agent that i paid less that the due amount then the next tells me i paid more. thirdly what is the point of the 3rd option because i might as well wait for month and use option 1. This treatment is horrific in particular for a brand as big as dstv, maybe because they dont really have competition in RSA as far as television programmes are concern now the dont care about professionalism. I hope this will trigger a much better solution to this problematic service i have experienced.	0	0	0	0	1	1

812	/dstv-multichoice/reviews/incompetent-accounts-department-2403255	Incompetent accounts department. On 23 October my wife took over the account from her mother that had about R500 in credit. Got the credit formed signed, so the bill at the end of October was basically R200. But because the debit order was only signed on 23 October, it was too late for the the Debit order run on 25 October, so they automatically added it to the debit order run for 25 November. Thinking everything was fine we carried on. Then suddenly on Saturday 4 November 8:00 in the morning, Bayer & Associates phones my wife demanding she pay R500 (R200 owed plus R300 fees) We went to the Multichoice Offices in Durban and they apologized about it., but we asked for a letter stating that they made a mistake in handing over the account. We were promised a letter but no letter came. Then on 25 November, the debit order goes off (R1100) but she gets another phone call from Bayer demanding R500! We wen back to the office and again they apologize, but they can't do anything from their side. A letter came back saying we have paid our account, but that is not the letter we want. We want an apology letter stating she should never have been handed over in the first place.  I want this resolved as soon as possible!	0	0	0	0	0	1

814	/dstv-multichoice/reviews/incompetent-and-unresponsive-1975023	Incompetent and Unresponsive I applied for the DSTV explorer 24 month promotion which requires me to pay R529 for 24 months on COMPACT subscription. After installation, I was called by a call center agent who then notified me that I would have to pay R899 at the end of February because I was on the PREMIUM package. I told him that I wasn't and he said he would \escalate\ it and I would receive a call back within 48 hours. This was on Wednesday 10 February. I did not receive any call. I called them on Tuesday 16 February and I was told that the matter would be escalated and I would receive a call back within 48 hours. They did not call me back. I called again on Monday 22 February and was told that the matter would be escalated and fixed in the next 24 hours and they would call me back again. No one bothered. I called on Tuesday 23 February and was told that Xolani specifically said I said I wanted the premium package. I told them I would have never said this because I can't pay R899 for TV which I watch only 4 hours a day. I told them to listen to the recordings of when I took out the contract. They said it would be escalated again & resolved in 24 hrs. Today its still not sorted. I am disappointed and angry.	0	0	1	1	0	0

On the 3rd the debit went off for the R1043.. This infuriating because your incompetent service has caused me to pay an amount I had not budgetted for.

I am beyond frustrated! First my dstv was disconnected because you said I am in arrears. Then when I pointed out that I only have one subscription and  you re-activated and charged for 2, they tried fixing the account but still *****ed it up. On the 2nd of October the normal debit order went off and I made an eft payment for the same amount. Which meant that I was covered for October and November. AFTER you made the mistake you are telling me I am still in arrears? When in actual fact you owe me a day because I was penalised for your system error. On Monday I requested a total account deactivation as of the 2nd of December 2017. Is there any competent person which will be able to understand and assist and that will confirm the deactivation???

821	/dstv-multichoice/reviews/incompetent-staff-at-multichoice-2383522	Incompetent staff at Multichoice Mid Oct - I contacted Multichoice to upgrade from the DSTV compact on Price lock to DSTV Compact plus. I waited a whole week for them to contact me and eventually someone called me and explained to me that compact plus is not part of price lock but instead I can pay for my hardware and pay for the recording functionality and the normal compact plus subscription. All good and we agreed on that. The lady then informed me that my next instalment will have a prorate amount because I upgrade\downgrade in the middle of the month. On Friday the 27th of Oct 2017 I received a massage stating that my next debit order amount of R3260.93 will be deducted on the 30th Oct. I called the call centre again and spoke to another lady and she was unable to explain to me why the amount to be debited was so high as I pay my dstv via debit order every month and I never skipped a payment. After 20 minutes I then ask to speak to the team lead on duty after explaining my story to him numerous times he advised me that there's nothing he can do but instead I must withdraw all my money from my account so that the debit can bounce back. I then told him that I have more than one debit order that must go off from my account and who will be liable for all the charges incurred for the debit orders that will bounce since there's no money in my account. He's reply to me I'll be liable for the charges because Multichoice will not carry the cost of all the returned debits. I was advised by him that he'll escalate and get back to me. On Tuesday the 31st The money went off from my account and I called in again I spoke to a lady in the accounts department and she advised me to call my bank and reverse the money and she will then contact the price lock team and find out what went wrong and call me back with the right amount to be paid on the account. Today 10th Nov still no reply from her but I get a notification that my services is suspended and I need to pay R949.93 before they reconnect my service. I called Multichoice again and spoke to someone in the call centre and she told me that she will also escalate and listen to recordings so she can find out what exactly happened on my account. For now my service is reconnect but I’m not happy with the service I received thus far.	0	0	0	1	1	1
822	/dstv-multichoice/reviews/incorrect-billing-2335969	Incorrect Billing I decided to join DSTV in June, against the warnings from friends and family telling me that its a bad idea.  I took the package for R959 for 24 moths so I can enjoy all there is to offer from DSTV.  The first month (June).. they didnt charge me anything...  The second month (July) They charged me R1186 The Third month (August) They charged me R1771  So my question is this.... WHY????  I left R1200 in my bank account... Bank charges and enough for DSTV's R959 This morning it tried to take the R1771 from my account and it bounced. So FNB charged me R100 for the debit order not going thru.  Is this really what DSTV is?? I really wish i didnt sgn up for it. I will NEVER recommend DSTV to anyone.  I KNOW they will not remimburse me for THEIR mistake.  The call centre agent this morning told me that the the issue can take up to 48 hours to fix. That means DSTV will try to take the R1771 AGAIN tommorow. Incurring another R100 charge from FNB.  WOW Thanks DSTV! You rock!	1	0	0	0	0	1
823	/dstv-multichoice/reviews/incorrect-billing-2362898	Incorrect Billing On Sunday morning, we recorded 1 which was airing in the morning. Around 9am when we woke up, my boyfriend realised that the show didn't record and we thought there was a problem with the decoder. So he called the to try and establish what could be the problem. The call was taken by Siphokazi Nakude who turned to be our worst nightmare. Not only was she unprofessional throughout the phone, but she so rude it was shocking. She couldn't explain to my boyfriend what the problem is properly and kept on interjecting whenever he tried to speak. He had to cut off the phone call as he realised he is not going to be assisted. We called back and asked to speak to the Supervisor whom we reported the matter to and he tried to assist and promised to investigate  Siphokazi's attitude and come back to us. To this day we've had no feedback and some of the channels are not working. To our shock, the DSTV services were disconnected yesterday and when we called we were told it was a system error. It seems to be bad service after the other from Multichoice. To say we are disappointed will be an understatement.	1	0	1	1	1	0

To my surprise I received a SMS date: 22-08-2018 saying that my account would  be debited with R949.00, which it was. I used the self service to inquire on this (date 24-08-2018), no one gets back to me. Today I call in to find out whats happening, and I'm told that the additional cost is for the recording on the Explora. This was not mentioned when the offer was made.

828	/dstv-multichoice/reviews/installation-problems-2024369	Installation Problems I am so disappointed in the service (or should I say lack of service) I have received from MultiChoice.  After a month and numerous phone calls following up from my side (because they promise that they will come back but oh no they don't) we have now received the Explora.  Now to get an accredited installer to install the Explora is another story.  The installer names I was provided with do not do the Explora deal installations. (Wonder why!).   So why do they offer and advertise the different options but they can't deliver.  Because they have the monopoly and they just don't care?  No wonder more and more people take the option of NetFlix...  The most frustrating thing is that every time you phone you speak to a different person and you have to repeat yourself a thousand times.  So I now sit with the Explora at home for a week now and I am still waiting for an installer... or somebody to phone me back.  Last person I spoke to was Minenhle Dlamini and still no resolution to my problem and her manager is too busy to speak to me and his/her manager is off today.	0	0	1	1	0	0

832	/dstv-multichoice/reviews/is-it-fraud-or-billing-mistake-2521755	Is it Fraud or Billing mistake Account paid for 1 year in advance - few days ago DSTV switched off due to no payment. Checked account and looks like someone fraudulently managed to transfer money out of the Multichoice account.   My problem is that Multichoice accepted a proof of payment that was not from the account holder. Nor did they confirm the transfer of monies out of the account holder's account with the Account holder.    My question: How is Multichoice protecting its clients from fraud?  Surely monies can only move out of an account if permission is granted by the account holder - being YOUR client.  Due to the mistake on DSTV billing  side - makes sense to request refund for the period we were without DSTV as DSTV disconnected our service in error.   Proof of payment sent - need our DSTV switched back on with immediate effect.  Smart card :  ********** 790	1	0	0	0	1	0
833	/dstv-multichoice/reviews/issue-caused-by-multichoice-results-in-cost-to-me-1963276	Issue caused by Multichoice,results in cost to me  Our new Explora's did not want to record. So we took them to the Centurion centre. After they were thoroughly checked by staff, the units were exchanged. With this exchange the current configurations were not copied/set up correctly. At home we have a complex installation. During my marathon call on Sunday 7 Feb to sort out the user band issue, the technician from Extreme Ops confirmed the units were still not configured for recording. He ticked the appropriate box for this to work, but could not get the user bank frequencies and indexes to work correctly.  As we have 3 Explora's and 1x HD decoder the user band frequencies and indexes were incorrect and not correctly set up from the Centurion MC office.   After spending most of Sunday 7 Feb on the phone with the call centre and Extreme Ops I was referred to the original installer.   My problem with this is that a simple \tick of a box\ for the recording function would have sufficed but now I have to pay a call out fee to an installer to fix the user band issue.   A Manager was supposed to  call me on Monday 8 Feb, but no call was received. Also sent an email from the DSTV site (impressed/depressed) no response.	0	0	1	0	0	0

838	/dstv-multichoice/reviews/lack-of-business-ethics-2665928	Lack of business ethics. Good day.  After endless phone calls and emails of proof of payments sent to senior officials at DSTV and their various departments, i got a call from a company called ccr on behalf of dstv for account arrear collections for the third time. And when i  call dstv call centre they tell me that they can see that my payment has been made but they have not allocated it to the account so i just have to keep getting phone calls from this collection agency until they allocate it. When you send them emails requesting feedback, it seems that either the person has died or the company just doesn't seem interested in replying to their customer requests.   At the time of my first incident i paid my account monthly as i should and they switched off my services due to non payment. I sent through my proof of payment to the proof of payment department and all the non allocated and account queries. To a senior called Thomas Monareng who never gave me any feedback. I then proceeded to end my services with dstv but to no avail because they have not allocated my payment. Its been 2 years now and every 2 to 3 months i get a nice phone call telling me that if i pay a certain amount today or tomorrow my services could be reconnected for a fee on top of the outstanding amount. After i directed the caller to rather go through the proper legal channels such as an attorney they tell me that we don't need to take things so far and that someone else would be phoning me to explain my need to pay money i have already paid better to me.   Its totally unacceptable and a pure lack of business ethics and loss of trust.	0	0	0	1	0	0

From my understanding, I am suppose to not view their services until I have payed the amount due, Last night I (05-02-2016) was disconnected, my dad paid the R320 and then when I was suppose to pay the R50 for re-connection fee, I am told I owe the R104.11 which was owing from last year.  My question why was this amount due not communicated with me that I owe re-connection fee from last year (2015) instead I was allowed to watch the services while I owe them, if I didn't call I wouldn't have knew about this amount as they have arrogance of not communicating with me instead just allowing me to coninue watching the services.	0	0	0	0	1	1

843	/dstv-multichoice/reviews/long-term-client-gets-pathetic-service-2600024	LONG TERM CLIENT GETS PATHETIC SERVICE I have been a customer of DSTV multichoice for over 10 years, diligently paying two Explora's with dual view for as long  I can recall.  I wake up on Saturday, 13th October 2018 my primary explora giving me problems whereby it keeps on loading forever. I disconnected the decoder and reluctantly took to DSTV Jabulani, and as I expected they didn't disappoint. Teboho told me they couldn't help because,  otherwise I had to pay R600 for an exchange.  Well, I decided to try elsewhere. I went to DSTV Maponya, and was assisted by Andile/Andiswa. I explained my situation, and was told that it is a common problem with exploras. And after waiting for sometime, still waiting for a power cable that was being used by her colleague, eventually she tested it trying to reset the decoder without any success. To cut a long story short, Mamzo as she is affectionately called in Maponya, came to my rescue by exchanging my explorer.   Took the explorer home, and tried connecting it. Unfortunately, I kept on getting error code DSTV E48-32. Eventually had to phone DSTV where I was charged R2.85c per minute and exhausted over R100.00 on airtime. Still, there was break through to my problem.  Later on, I discovered that I will be billed R2600 on the 18th of this month. And when I called the DSTV call center, I was told that the lady(Andile/Andiswa) at DSTV Maponya who was exchanging the decoders billed me for November, December and January all at once. As for why, I do not know.  This ridiculous service received from DSTV employees in exception of Mamzo has simply reminded me of why I need to reconsider DSTV as a whole.  If this is what I get as a long term NEVER DEFAULTING customer, good luck to the rest!   If Multichoice want's to help it's competitors such as Netflix, it's doing a fantastic job!  My cancellation will now be processed.  Actually I tried this online with no success.  (So I will try doing this through the long telephonic/email process that I assume they will delay since why should the cancellation be any more efficient than asking for any other service.)	1	0	0	1	0	1

848	/dstv-multichoice/reviews/management-involvement-lacking-2426027	Management involvement lacking I applied for an Explora 2 with Multichoice.  They called me and I went through the whole credit approval, and the consultant confirmed that it was approved.  He requested that I send credit documents which I immediately done on the 5th of January already.  They confirmed with a return e-mail that the e-mail will be attended to within 48 hours.  Yesterday afternoon on a Sunday I receive an e-mail, 9 DAYS LATER, (when I was already excited and expecting delivery to be today or soon) I received an e-mail requesting further documents.  How disappointing!!!!!!!  I then tried to contact the credit approval department via the customer service department.  The lady stated I can only get hold of them via e-mail and not on the phone.  I sent an e-mail about how unhappy I am with this whole procedure taking so long, and nobody even bothered to call or e-mail me back.    Does Multichoice only exist out of Customer Service agents and Management does not exist???  When I tried searching for some form of manager or supervisors e-mail address to try to get my complaint attended to, nothing.  They hide behind a contact centre, can this be true???   It is 14H20, and still no reply.  I contacted the call centre this morning to try to speak to management in the credit department and that is not possible?  They will not even let a person talk to the Secretary of the CEO?  Does top management realize how much business they are loosing due to one or two flaws in the system?  The lady Supervisor from the call centre patiently listened to my complaint and told me she will get back to me during the course of the day, but with all due respect,  does this mean anything?  Does management know I had a complaint from my e-mail with the subject: Bad service attention management?  I don't mind.  They can cancel my subscription due to me sending this complaint.  That is fine with me.  I hope I make a difference to the future applications and prevent future people from the same poor service.   Does a person get better service from walking into a Franchise and they have to pay them commission, but at least then the job gets done?  Was that what I was supposed to do.	0	0	1	1	0	0

Client code:  ********** 8  We recieved a call from Dstv promising us a free explorer for being loyal clients. The condition was that we upgrade to the premiere package, because we were on the compact bouquet. The upgrade was done last week. Since last week we have been making calls to Dstv and all the consultants that I spoke to promised a callback from the department that deal with the offer. Instead I received a call from the pricelock department, which is not what been promised to us.   So, was we misled to upgrade to the premiere package with a false promise? I'm really disappointed in the service and the company's incompetent consultants, with the teamleaders. Because consultants say that the teamleader will call us. They even read the notes on the system, but nothing is happening and everytime I have to use my airtime to do a follow up.  Please, check into this matter as soon as possible.

Like most South African's I have been a loyal subscriber for years as a Premium subscriber.  I've paid my monthly payment without fail as expensive as it is- but it is worth it for my family. My subscription was cut off on the 21st of abruptly because they claim there is payment outstanding for August 2018!  All payment are paid using my smartcard ref- have been for years.  I had to call in because no one let me know (bullying tactic right there). Then I'm told that there was a payment that was reversed in August of last year. I share with them that I made a payment (proof supplied) and DSTV debited after . Then their own call centre agent told me  to reverse the debit order as it would take forever to get my funds (conversation recorded).  Then the person  I am emailing all these different payment - which required me to stop working (as I work for myself) and go through all my transaction history up to 180 days.  Still they haven't sorted anything out! Woke up to a disconnected viewing on Wednesday. I KEEP GETTING MESSAGES TO PAY R2108 WHAT THE HELL!!  I don't owe a prepaid service- everyone knows , you miss a payment DSTV never fails to disconnect. No one is communicating with me except the sms' I keep getting. Its like they are saying - ***** you- ***** the 12 plus thousand Rends you spend per year on this subscription.  I am definitely not a valued customer.   My daughter is worried if we will have dstv next week because she knows I refuse to pay for money I DO NOT OWE! I don't have extra money laying around in case your system messes up- it doesn't work like that AT ALL.

Hi Hello Peter, I'm SO dissatisfied with the service from DSTV Multi-choice.  I have taken ownership of my late Grandfather's Multi-choice account and recently his decoder has been giving issues, so I had to buy a new one.   Unfortunatley the installer of my new device did not know the history of the old device and thought that the transfer of funds from one account to the other would be easy. Truth is I have asking for assistance since mid November 2018 and have been from Columbine Agency to Multi-choice head office and NOBODY is able to assist, the ones that want to can't because the procedures in place are too COMPLICATED to do the transfer of funds. A bank statement and death certificate will not surfice as proof of payment of Death .  DSTV wants an Executor letter for a person that died 18 years ago, and proof of payments from a Standing order, the statement won't do.  The amount of money I would have to pay an Executor for a letter is not worth the credit due from DSTV to Myself. Why are things so COMPLICATED when it's time to credit or refund a person for something that they have made payment for and have given proof of that payment?	0	0	0	1	0	0
858	/dstv-multichoice/reviews/multichoice-2640164	Multichoice Good day  I have an issue. I paid my dstv account double on the 26th of November. I usually pay two different dstv accounts but this time I made a mistake of paying the two amounts into the same account. I only realized after the other dstv was switched off that I made a double payment. I called in the call centre to ask that the other amount be transferred into the other account(the one that is switched off) and even paid a reconnection fee of R50. I was asked to provide the proof of payment of which I sent through to Tshwarelo Mmileng. I sent through both proofs(the initial payment and the reconnection fee) till this day my mother is sitting with dstv that is not working. When I phoned again this morning they told me that they will flag it and it will be rectified.  When I call in again this afternoon then I am told that it takes upto seven days for that to be rectified by someone in finance meanwhile my mother is sitting with a dstv that is not working.

860	/dstv-multichoice/reviews/multichoice-are-crooking-their-customers-2397850	MultiChoice are crooking their customers I have a R99-00 DSTV Access subscription which I have signed and have been regularly paying for in the previous month. However, I was shocked when I went to pay my subscription on Monday 27/11/2017 when I went to pay my DSTV subscription at O.K furnitures when the cashier said instead of paying R99.00 , I must pay R120.  I did not pay that amount and paid instead the normal R99.00 , and I paid R100, with an additional R1.00 on top of the R99.00. I then decided to call MultiChoice to enquire about the additional R20 on Wednesday 29/11/2017. They told it's insurance, which I have never signed up for. And now they want to shut down the service because I owe the additional R19 for insurance which I have NEVER consented to. I was speaking to a guy by the name of Immanuel Nkosi  and he promised to escalate this matter, but still they have not fixed the mess they made regarding insurance I have never signed up for.  I am thinking to change to OVHD or StarSat, if MultiChoice is going to crook its customers in this manner and writing to ICASA and the Consumer Goods Council, regarding this this Consumer exploitation practice.

Never the less I didn’t get assistance I called in everyday and was informed the matter has been escalated, I couldn’t even rent a movie on box office or watch anything on catchup, eventually I called back again on Tuesday the 23rd and explained everything to the call centre agent as expected she could not assist and referred me to our closest technicians, my husband took the decoder to the technicians they told him to leave it there and TODAY the 29th of April 2019 we get the same faulty decoder back because even the technicians cant assist......So at this point we've had it, I’m fed up and want to cancel this entire deal because I cannot continue to beg for assistance from the world’s most incompetent people EVER! and then the consultant explains they will be charging a cancellation fee because we are cancelling the offer...........Is this not completely absurd, how the hell are you even this deranged to charge me a fee for cancelling a freaking product that has been of absolutely no use to me, and mind you it was not even everything advertised, because I received a FAULTY decoder in the first place..........	0	1	0	1	0	0
866	/dstv-multichoice/reviews/multichoice-dstv-payment-crooks-2470523	MULTICHOICE DSTV PAYMENT CROOKS • On the 08/01/2018 I got an additional Compact dish for my second home and I paid a pro rata of R216 and full amount of R720 on the 24/01/2018 for both connections; • On the 23/02/2018 I made payment of R730; • On the 08/03/2018 (two weeks after payment date) there was a break in at home; TV was stolen; I called to cancel the connection of: 4 **********  222 (At my Mother’s house in East London); spoke with Olebogeng April who told me he cannot cancel it immediately BUT can schedule for cancellation after my payment date. He also said because I cancelled two weeks before/after the payment date (25 March 2018) I have a credit/change of R200+ (not sure of the exact amount) which will be transferred to the remaining connection of : 1 **********  225 (At my house in Port Elizabeth) and only have to pay R100+ (not sure of the exact amount). • On the 09/03/2018 I called again to activate the same connection as my Mother informed me that she connected her old small TV and the pictures are clear so she feels like the connection is there. I spoke with Magdeline Mabuya who told me it was not disconnected anyway the previous day. • On the 10/03/2018 I called again to disconnect it again because my Mother told me only SABC and ETV are playing, the DSTV channels are not there and I spoke with Namhla Manjanja; who also confirmed what Lebohang told me on the 08/03/2018 that it can only be disconnected after the payment date. I asked her about the credited (pro rata) amount that Lebohang told me about, she said there is no such thing. I have to pay the full amount of the remaining connection. As your calls are recorded please check that conversation. • Yesterday I just checked how much am I to pay this month and its R307.01 which I dispute. • Today the 22/03/2018 I just spoke with Freddie Williams to get clarity of the amount; he told me because I did not cancel immediately on the 08/03/2018 but only scheduled for disconnection for the 25th; I do not qualify for any refund from the disconnection. I explained to him that Lebohang and Namhla told me I cannot cancel immediately it has to be after the payment date. He said there is no such as he was able to cancel it immediately today. • My complaints is regarding Lebohang and Namhla for their misleading information. Especially Lebohang because he is the one who told me about the refund even if disconnection will only be done after payment date. • I need my refund as I did not benefit any viewing from the 08/03/2018 till today. And I called the same day to inform your Employees.  I am not happy with nthe response I got from their Facebook page. Its a pity that its a messenger communication that I cannot attach here. But in a nutshell they saying as much as on the 08/03 I was told that the procedure is they cannot cancel immediately, can only be scheduled for cancellation on the 25th BUT it was immediately cancelled and I had a refund of R227.45 and because I called again on the 09/03 to reactivate, I forfeited the refund. Although Magdeline on the 09/03 told me there was no cancellation on the 08/03 only a schedule AND DSTV FB was dishonest and said it was cacelled immediately on the 08/03. They said when I called on the 10/03 to cancel it AGAIN, Namhla did not cancel it because it was ALREADY cancelled on the 08/03 by Lebohang. She only rescheduled it for cancellation AND no refund.  Someone is knot telling the truth. My questions are: Why did Lebohang on the 058/03 said it cannot be cancelled immediately AND I have a refund? And later decided to bend the rules and work procedure and cancel it immediately? Why did Magdeline on the 09/03 said there was no disconnection only a schedule for the 25th? If Lebohang on the 08/03 managed to cancel it immediately; why didnt Namhla cancel it on the 10/03?  Where is the refund that was available 24hrs ago, whether cancelled OR scheduled?  DSTV FB stopped responding after I posed these questions.	0	0	0	1	0	1
867	/dstv-multichoice/reviews/multichoice-fcked-me-over-2329449	Multichoice f#cked me over!!! My husband bought me the Explora 2, about 2 or so months ago. Since day one, I have been having problems with the Explora 2. It seems that the times set on the system and the times displayed on the menu’s, are not the same. Meaning that once I set something to record or set as a reminder, about 30 minutes later, it would only start recording or take me to that channel, for the reminder. The times are all wrong. I have had DSTV people at my house 3 times already (and they broke my wall, trying to get to the cable socket in the wall) and I have been to the Multichoice offices also. Including calling the help-desk (reset and restart each time) for advice aswell, on several occasions already. I am highly ****ed off by all the above said, seeing as I am paying a huge amount for this service each day, but im not getting what I have been paying for! I was told by the help-desk each time just to do the channel scanning and then reset the Explora 2. Once I went to the Multichoice offices, two separate people helped me. The first person (lady), told me that my switch is not needed and that she can fix my problem, if she empties my internal hard drive (meaning delete all my recorded movies). I recorded her saying that on my phone. She then called another man over and he then just did a few things and said that the Explora 2 will be ok now. ITS NOT!!! I want Multichoice to give me a BRAND NEW EXPLORA 2, immediately!!! Im not standing for this constant running around and wasting my time and money on things that is supposed to be working properly.

And when will it be refunded? 2) Your feedback refers to the access fee: R90.00 for Access service fee (PVR recording functionality), while on understanding the statement it is stated as follow: What is the Access Fee for? The Access Fee gives you more than one viewing environment without having to pay additional subscriptions. It’s also flexible enough to cater for the unique needs of your household.

SUPERVISORS !??  1) Transfer the R152.71 surplus credit on my main account to my holiday acc      This credit is due to a Journal correction that was processed incorrectly for just      the balance owing in stead of the incorrect term fix in its entirety (See below) 2) Correction: Viewing duration of weekend  30.10.2015 > 01.11.2015 (3 days)     shows on your records as 30.10.2015 > 17.11.2015 (19 days!)     The incorrect days needs to be reversed on the holiday account.  ** Take into consideration that Nr1 was an incorrect attempt of Nr2, so yes you have now complicated it !!

874	/dstv-multichoice/reviews/multichoice-not-sticking-to-their-contracts-as-offered-by-their-staff-2029495	Multichoice - not sticking to their contracts as offered by their staff I received an offer for the Price Lock plan via email which detailed that I will pay R 529 for Compact, an Explorer installation and including an add on channel. This was also confirmed with the 2 consultants whom I spoken with when taking up the offer. Upon my debit date I was billed in excess of R 800. Upon raising this discrepancy with Multichoice on the first 2 occasions thereafter, I was told that I would be contacted back by the Price Lock (BDD) department with 2-24 hours on each occasion. After more than a week of waiting, and after calling for the 3rd time, today I was told by a manager, Absolom, that the offer did not include the add on channel and that I misinterpreted the offer. When asked why had the 2 consultants who  did the application not explained this, even after constantly telling them that I want my packages to stay as it is, the manager did not have anything to say. I am now being told to cancel the add on with my family loves watching or pay the higher premium. Lets be honest DSTV is not cheap but customers cannot be taken for a ride especially with such poor service thereafter. I challenge DSTV to retrieve all my calls made to them for the last 5 weeks and still tell me that I am wrong as a customer. I want DSTV to firstly refund me the difference of the premiums and then bill me the correct premium that was offered and agreed to by their consultants. Good companies offerr good service but great companies have integrity. Lets see if DSTV can stick to theirs.	0	0	0	1	0	1

If at all possible can you cancel the contract for price lock, as it gives me endless headaches since 2017.................I would rather buy a decoder cash and then consider taking it from there, as requested last year please collect your decoder, as the agent you send to install, only used my own wires from previous connections.

Once i realized this error, i contacted and emailed Multichoice and sent them the proof of payment and requested for this error to be rectified. After 4 emails and 6 months later, i have still not heard from them or had any correction processed on my account.  They have however informed me during this time that my account is overdue and i had to process a duplicated payment because the original payment made was allocated to a Suspense/Unallocated account.  This has impacted me financially and the attitude of Multichoice would seem that they don't care about their customers or service to their customers. I find this unacceptable and would like this matter resolved urgently. For customers to wait 6 months for action is not acceptable. 	0	0	0	1	0	0

The two years is finally up and I get the message that my contract is now expired and I need to pay cash on a month to month basis. I paid cash and guess what they did  debit my account so I contact them and instead two days later they double debit my account again. So in essence t have paid R4000 for one month's viewing and when I reverse the three debits they suspend my services. So anybody considering price lock or even dstv I got need for you I cannot wait for my wifi to be connected and I can throw both explpra decoders away as I wouldn't want to sell them to anybody or even give them away for the headache it will cause the next person	0	0	0	1	1	1

I received an email to upgrade to premium for a month for same amount R599. My debit order then was deducted at the Premium levy of above R800. They extended it for another month and again deducted the higher premium. I then canceled the debit order and decided to rather pay online the correct amount. The instruction on the website for online states choose  pre-approved beneficiary Multichoice for internet banking . There was only Multichoice Namibia which I chose. Apparently I should have chosen DSTV.  I can not reverse as it was an internet payment. They wanted a proof of payment with bankstamp. Now they say the beneficiary account details are wrong and they can not transfer it to my DSTV account. It is a pre approved beneficiary so I do not get to choose. I sent numerous emails and stand in the queue twice to try to sort. If they check the banking details on the 28th of April, they will pick up the payment and can transfer to my account.

Like currently i have the same problem and i am just gatvol to phone and spend 20 minutes/R200 for you guys to provide some sort of poor service. The worst thing of all is that Multichoice does not have a policy of financially rewarding/reimbursing their customers for not receiving the service they should be getting.

885	/dstv-multichoice/reviews/my-details-were-fraudulently-used-2519940	My details were fraudulently used Hi Mpho,  Please escalate this matter to whoever is responsible.  Series of events:  On the 15th May I received an email stating the below.   You have successfully linked the following Smartcard number to your Connect ID:  Linked smartcard :  ********** 038 - DTHIUC   If you did not link the Smartcard number to your Connect ID, please email our Customer Care at  **********  to report this. Please note it is important to report this immediately to avoid unauthorised access to your account information and services.   I then emailed the above email address and was told to do a live chat. I did the live chat and was told my Smangele that the message was sent in error.   On the 25th May we were cut off.  My husband called Multichoice to find out what was happening and he was informed that they needed to speak to me as the account holder not him. I was at work at the time but I called as requested. The call centre agent told me that my son had called on 15th May to deactivate my account and open another one for R99. I was shocked because I have a 3 year old son and he could not have called. The address and the cell number that the call centre agent gave me were not mine. I was told there is a Malelane address on the DSTV system yet I have never set foot in that town. Who authorized this change of address and contact details? I was told that I had 4 decoders in my name. The agent however changed back my details to the correct ones and then reconnected me. If my “son” called on the 15th, why did Smangele not tell me that on the live chat? Why did she also tell me that the email was sent in error?   26th May I spoke to Dylan and told him my problem. I told him that I needed an investigation on this issue as I was worried that someone out there has my details and is using them fraudulently. He said he will listen to recording of my “son’s call and come back to me. He never did.  30th May We were disconnected again on this day. I called the call centre and expressed my anger with DSTV about the frequent disconnections and the non- communication. Dylan had not called even though it was a Wednesday. The lady I spoke to did not even try to understand my anger and what was happening instead she became rude and told me my son called. I got more angry as I felt I am required to keep repeating the same thing about the “son” who I said is not mine. She did not apologise or even offer to investigate what happened instead she took this too personal telling me I deal with different agents and that she did not refuse to speak to my husband and that someone else did.  I asked to speak to her supervisor. That was also a waste of my time as she was worse than her. At the end of the call she blatantly refused to give me her name and said that the reference number ( ********** 2i20) she gave me is sufficient. She threatened to cancel everything and even told me that I will remain disconnected until the investigation is complete. The attitude I got from the agents was so bad, they don’t know how to deal with frustrated customers, they make them feel like culprits. Nobody understood that my details are out there and being used fraudulently, no apology, no humility, just a bad attitude. Nobody could tell me why they refused to speak to my husband on the 25th yet they can speak to my “so called” son.   A few minutes later, I received an sms stating  that I owe multichoice therefore I have been disconnected. I then decided to drive from the South of Joburg to Randburg in order to get a face to face explanation of what happened. I spoke to Nonhlanhla Malinga, she was excellent. She removed the other decoders off my name. She listened to my “son”’s call and then told me that this “son” had all my details and ID number. She asked me to send her an affidavit and said that she will forward it to the fraud department. I have since done that.   *I don’t understand why Smangele did not tell me that my son had called and that the connection I was querying was requested by this “son”. If she had told me on that day, none of this could have happened *I don’t understand why DSTV always refuse to speak to my husband and yet spoke to my “son” *I don’t understand why my details were changed without my knowledge *Why do I have 4 decoders in my name? Who authorized them? The calls for activation of these accounts need to be checked too *Why didn’t the person that I spoke to on the 25th escalate this matter to the fraud department and remove the other 3 decoders?  *Aren’t the agents trained to apologise for any inconvenience customers go through due to fraudulent activities that DSTV allow to happen to their account? Someone there changed my details without checking the legitimacy of the calls made on “my behalf”.  *Why was I threatened by the supervisor? Is it okay for her to refuse to give me her details?   To this day, nobody from multichoice has called me to give me feedback. I can't always follow up with them.	1	1	1	0	1	1
886	/dstv-multichoice/reviews/my-refund-will-be-paid-back-in-40-days-instead-7-1974196	My refund will be paid back in 40 days instead 7 In January I signed up for the DSTV-explora payment plan, I was advised that immediately the explora is installed I should call DsTV and cancel my old premium package, transfer to DPP plan which I did with the installer there. On the 15/02/16 they over debited my account, the reason being the credit that was in my old account was not transferred to the new account which made the new account to be in arrears. How do you close an account that still has money in it  and double debit me for the new one? I called on the 15/02/16 to ask for the funds in my old account to be refunded back to me and they agreed and said it will take 7 days (reference:77578496-I33). Today 7 days later I speak to a consultant called Thabisile who tells me it takes 40 days for the refund to be paid back to me, the other consultant on the 15th should have advised me to ask my bank to reverse the debit order instead of them refunding and to top it off the request was not logged on their system to refund me she will have to start from scratch...WHAT???This is not acceptable, Ive never had issues with their accounts department but im truly dissappointed this time...can I please have my money back as in yesterday.	0	0	0	1	0	1

Every 9 months I find that I have to take time out of my life to go and explain to dstv that there billing system doesn't work. I pay you and if you want to take it off three different accounts that's your dumb ideas. I really don't care how many accounts you have given me. Fix it. I don't want credits and I really don't care about your terms and conditions. I pay you cash well in advance of the debt order date so there is no need for your incompetent staff to do a debit order. But it's to charge a debit order as you don't have to think about what is actually happening to a customer's account. When are you finally going to pull your act together and sort my account out. I don't want credits or anything else like that just an account that reflects what's going on. I am really sick of this happening all the time 	1	0	0	0	0	0

Called the call centre again and i was informed that they are busy working on my account and my account will be debited and credited once the debit of the incorrect amount has been collected on my set debit date. Is this what you call service DSTV. I made 5 calls to you to fix the problem. I called at the beginning of the month and until now you still cant fix the problem.

894	/dstv-multichoice/reviews/no-catchup-no-box-office-no-showmax-2560636	NO CATCHUP NO BOX OFFICE NO SHOWMAX Two weeks ago our Box office AND Dstv Catchup  lost all content on our explora 1 and cannot be accessed. When scrolling through the menu and choosing  Box office a message on the screen comes up saying:  NOT AVAILABLE IN YOUR REGION .  When choosing  Catchup, a message saying:  NOT AVAILABLE IN YOUR COUNTRY  is displayed.  I have contacted the Multichoice call center 10 times now but no information is forth coming except the technicians are working on it !  We have checked over the settings  several times with no fault or signal deficiency on my setup.  Further frustrations are: No communication from Multichoice on progress. Call center supervisors not available. Call center supervisors do not get back to me when promised to.  The call center supervisor whom i eventually did get to speak with on my last call promised to get back to me even if it was to say that he could not get info...he also did not  get back to me yet. The local Multichoice agents say they are aware of the problem but their hands are cut off as they don't get information either. I was told by one operator that over a 100 000 subscribers had the problem, but, i don't see the social media chatter that surely this amount would generate. Further to this conflicting info and statements are being given to me by the call center which indicates they do not know what they are doing.  I also have a problem with my Showmax content which will not start playing after the notification and time count down . It comes up with an error saying that i must check my connectivity which as i have mentioned has been checked and found ok numerous times.  I have been transferred to other people by the call center only to have this problem also not sorted out yet.  I found out only yesterday by chance that Catchup is working on my extraview PVR 2U decoder in another room.   How is it possible that these problem are not being attended to while we are still paying without  fault.  We are getting a gross unprofessional brush off by Multichoice . Please can immediate attention be given to my problem starting with a call by some capable agent who can fix the problem without delay.	0	0	1	1	0	0
895	/dstv-multichoice/reviews/no-customer-service-2645544	No customer service... Good day,   I am very disappointing with DStv...  I phoned in a month or so ago about a possible upgrade and the guy said he will send through my details to the price lock department for further information about the package and guess what price lock department upgraded my package without my consent! On the 10th of December an amount of R723.50 was debited off which it returned because of insufficient funds (my account is normally R654pm) and, I immediately phoned customer service and yes  I was very upset because I had to pay for the return debit fee, my line was cut short because of my minutes that was finished so the following day, I contacted customer service again on 11th December so this was the second consultant, I spoke to also promising me the moon and the stars with no feedback or outcome what so ever... Than 3 days  later, I spoke to another consultant same story different day no feedback no outcome NOTHING!!! This morning, I spoke to a supervisor called Micha and she advised me that its not her department but will send through my details of that was no help cause same story different day its been 4hours and no call as of yet....  Now  tell me why do you have customer service I am very annoyed and very irritated by this service cause this is not my first case of consultants not listening to me where they had to review the voice recording to find out that the consultant made a mistake, that matter was resolved quickly as to this matter of which no one wants to take responsibility.  I have all the consultants names and reference numbers I took with all my calls, If anyone would be so kind as to contact me about this query please  Thank you Shirmel Azure - Booley	0	0	1	1	0	1

I received a missed call from the same number that one of the supervisors called me from yesterday. I called trying to track down Thomas. The agent told me she doesn't know any supervisor by the name of Thomas, not even willing to find out if maybe her colleagues knows him, I then asked to speak to any supervisor. She then puts me on hold for a good 10 minutes. Decided to hang up coz it was just a waste of my airtime, who knows probaly she wasn't even trying to get hold of her supervisor. I then called again, spoke to a lady by the name of Catherine. I can't believe how she said \I can not hear you\ and the tone, instead of excuse me. I honestly can't believe how many times I've been treated badly by agents from Multichoice. They have no passion for service and no customer service at all.

The first month they did not debit and I called them back and confirmed my banking details and a debit went through thereafter.  I never took notice thereafter, I happened to draw my credit record this week and found out that multichoice is recording me as a non payer, I then realised they have not been debiting my account.  They have also not been calling to find out why payments are not going through.  I called them twice and the call center staff cant help they advise I will be called back, and no one calls me back!!!  Multichoice has very poor customer service and clearly also has poor admin services.  They failed to deduct and now tainted my good credit report with their poor administration.

In the 2 months since the second installation i have spent well over an hour, if not close to 2 hours on various telephone calls to the call center and still i experience the EXACT same disruption to my service, for which i have paid. What i cannot understand is why is it so difficult to have this resolved??? It has been escalated and passed on from one person to the next, but the same thing still happens (E16-4 Notification). Next step is to cancel both my Premium Packages and move to a Netflix or similar platform. There has not been one year, since i became a subscriber (some 12+ Years ago) that i have not experienced a problem with DSTV Multichoice. In my eyes certainly the worst service provider that i deal with.	0	0	0	1	0	0

They certainly dont mind receiving my monthly subscription which is paid via debit order. Besides making a complete botch up of my holiday view in the first place, it is a constant battle to get decent service from them. The website states \typically responds within an hour\. It has now been 32 hours with no response. I refuse to pay for any holiday viewing after yesterday. In fact, we are seriously considering cancelling our dstv subscription.

I phone them and the say just pay the outstanding balance.  So we organize that the extra R55 or so goes off with the next debit order.

Then a few days later I receive a message  that the next debit order will be for R1223 and some cents.  Once again I phone customer care, only to be told that the amount is that high because of pro rata billing, BUT YOUVE ALREADY BEEN PAID BY DEBIT ORDER FOR THE MONTH SO ONLY R55 SHOULD BE ADDED TO THE NEXT DEBIT ORDER!!!!!!!!! So how the heck do you bill me again for a month that has already been paid for????? By now I have had enough of your incompetence and I cancel my DSTV subscription, and since I cancelled it in the month that has already been paid for, According to your consultant, I only had to pay the outstanding R55, which I did.  Well, to my surprise I see that even after cancelling  my DSTV, the debit order for the R1223 still went off.  I want this sorted out and the money erroneously debited from my account paid back immediately.  I have the email communication from your consultant stating that my DSTV was cancelled and that i will not have DSTV from the 27th of July.  well its the 27th of July, my dish is still working and you took the money.

I contact the call center only to be told that the debit orders only go off on the 4th so I am charged access fees. R129 access fees for a few days?  On top of that they bill me the whole R844 which includes access fees.  I have requested a refund and I was assured that I would be contacted within 48 hours.  It has been a week with no contact from DSTV.   I have sent an email to their contact us division, clearly no one is monitoring the mailbox.  As a premium customer who pays a premium price for 99% of the things that I do not care to watch on DSTV, the least I expect is premium service.

I then called into the Multichoice call center to rectify this. The lady i spoke to did not have an idea of the special i was talking about. She then place me on hold, and came back to say that she rectified the upgrade.  So, in my mind i have been upgraded to the R599 special. Somewhere around the 25th of February, i made payment of R600. I then got a sms that i have to pay R411 more because i did not pay enough. And a debit order of R353.59 went off.

After I spoke to a consultant who promised, after a Hello Complaint ,that this will be resolved, and I should not have a problem again.  I think it is one thing to call and respond to a Hello Peter query, telling the client what they want to hear. But I believe the success of any query resolution, is in communicating the correct information, and managing expectations based on that.  With Multichoice my experience has been that every agent promises that I won't have the same issue again, only to have the same problem exactly 2 days later.  Spend the time understanding the query and then propose a solution.  Many thanks,  Mamogale	0	0	0	1	1	0

I told Lerato last night how can the system ask me now for R204 due when on the 21st April I already even paid R400 towards 02 May payment, so thus they want to charge me R605 etc when only R525 is required each month.

920	/dstv-multichoice/reviews/over-billing-fraud-2440317	Over Billing Fraud My account was debited with R2701.50 for the price lock contract. Upon querying this amount (on Thursday 1 Feb 2017) I was told that I have not paid the additional decoder which costs R89 / month. I asked the consultant to please escalate the matter and to investigate this as I suspect  fraud as I have been paying my account every month. I was informed that I will be contacted by a manager the following day. I am still awaiting this call.  The fact of the matter is...Since 28 November 2016 till 28 December 2017, I have been paying on an average R1216 / month. Price lock costs R959 + R89 = R1048 / month. How is it possible that I can be in arrears?  This is blatant fraud from Multi-choice.	0	0	1	0	0	1
921	/dstv-multichoice/reviews/over-debit-and-lack-of-acknowledgement-1956082	Over Debit and Lack of acknowledgement  My account was more than double debited on Rhe first of February and when I talk to the consultants they keep insisting that it wasn't like I am mad. Why would I take my time to call and complain if there wasn't a problem. This is a major inconvenience on my budget and I am annoyed that they tell me of the red tape around the bank clearance on their side (which is not my problem cause I am not the one who over paid them, they took from me instead). I sent the statement proving what they keep denying that my account was over charged and now I wait (which is not fair). 	0	0	0	1	0	1

923	/dstv-multichoice/reviews/overdebited-2514744	Overdebited Over debited 2 months still not resolved. They never get back to you they lie absolutely appalled.  I had bad customer service before but nothing like this  Let me start the overdebit was due to a system error it  billed me 24 months worth of debits in one month. Usual debit is 1123pm I was debited 2400.00 all they had to do was reverse an oversellment. It's been 2months noone there is compitant enough to do this. Would you believe it  To make matters worse I then get told to go to my bank reverse the funds so I did the full 2400 as instructed by the agent. Necepo  To my surprise I get billed 3500 this month now stay with me I was expecting to be double billed due to the reversal of funds the month before which should total up for two months   And that is what should have been debited but again they overdebited me.  Now let's do some basic math something DStv agents despirately need training on  Normal debit is 1123.00pm  27th April I am billed 2466.00 Why? The system billed me 79 over 24 months so over billed by 1400 I just needed DStv to reverse overpayment back into my bank account did not happen as Agen advised I had to go to my bank who reversed full 2466.00   With that been said I was expecting a double bill for last month 1123 +1123 = 2246 but I was billed 3500  Take 3 **********  = 1343.00   So 1343.00 is what they overdebited me again why because the first reversal of 1400 was never fixed  It's been 2months running no joy  If there is someone who knows what they doing at DStv please call me  Ref no  ********** 3 after the digit 5 I got cut off I can't deal  Is the 1400 going to be reversed and debited back to me  Is someone actually going to be calling me  Or shall I speak to another 10 agents and get no where  Once my contact expires I don't think I will ever return to DSTV ever Will joining Netflix you will loose good customers due to your appalling customer service you don't really care about your customers this is plain to see I am very disappointed I have been with you for years and this is the manner in which you deal with customers.

Multichoice and its callcentres are the most appaulling and unproffessional service provider to deal with. I have been a DSTV customer for more than 8 years now and as per ussual, I've had a debit order for the duration of being a customer. 2 months ago I opted and took out the pricelock deal of R959 a month for 24 months. August they deducted the contracted amount of R959 so all went well, this month so far they have deducted R4000 when I phoned the callcentre this is apparently the amount I owe Multichoice. I went through my account history and no where do I see a month has been skipped for the debit orders.So where do they find that 4000 rand is owed to them.They also deducted the 4000 in 2 seperate deductions. After the 1st deduction the Agent gaurenteed that this will be investigated and no deduction will be taken off until the first 2000 is paid back. Now no one is able to assist or help us resolve this, but they could happily deduct money from my account without knowing what it is for.	0	0	0	0	0	1

Ill treatment of loyal paying customer. Multichoice has been disconnecting my service, charging reconnection fees even though my account was paid o time. I have had numerous conversations with their call centre, including a supervisor and all have failed to ensure that my payment has been properly allocated.  I keep receiving sms's telling me how much I owe, with a past due date. Some of these sms's have been to notify me that service has been disconnected and all the time I have to keep phoning them to reconnect because its a mistake on their side. They've asked me to send a POP which I have and everyone can see. I have also noted that some of the agents I have spoken to, including the call where I spoke to a supervisor, are not logging the interactions as the lat person I spoke to at 07:00 yesterday morning, named Sbusiso, could not pick my last interaction. Nevermind that we pay exorbitant amounts for old and repeated programming, now they don't even acknowledge payment received. Pathetic service all round!!!!

934	/dstv-multichoice/reviews/pathetic-dstv-service-2729199	Pathetic DSTV Service At the end of March 2019 we had a problem with signal.  After several phone calls to MultiChoice I was advised to bring the 2 decoders in to the N1 City branch.  Both decoders were reset.  As a result we could not view a picture at all on our 2nd TV.  I once again called MultiChoice and was told that I would have to get in a technician at our cost.  Apparently all our settings were overwritten.  During my phone calls I heard that our premium subscription would be R180.00 more for May 2019.  I was surprised as DSTV made a huge announcement that the premium subscription would not increase and remain at the old rate.    I once again called MultiChoice and spent more than 20 minutes on the phone between 3-5 April to be told that the error lies with their Insurance Department which had billed us incorrectly.  The lady in that Dept confirmed it and advised that it was rectified.  Yesterday we received notification that our premium subscription would be R1133 for the month of May.  Another call to MultiChoice was made and I demanded to speak with a Supervisor.  Bongani (forgive me if the spelling is not correct) assisted me (30mins later on my mobile) and also advised that their Insurance Deptwas at fault.  He transferred me to them and once again was advised that it was rectified and I should check the account in the afternoon and should reflect the correct payment.  Suprise!!!!!! nothing was amended.   I spoke with KEOAGILE at MultiChoice this morning who promised that someone from the Insurance Department would call me back.  We are on the point of cancelling our DSTV premium subscription if it is not resolved by lunch time today.  MultiChoice lost so many premium subscribers in 2018 and they set to lose another.  It would appear that they do not care about their customers.  It has been a month long battle with them.	1	0	0	1	0	1

936	/dstv-multichoice/reviews/pathetic-service-2379164	Pathetic Service So I forgot to pay my DSTV until it got disconnected, so I made payment on the 01-11-2017. Because it took longer than normal to disconnect I then call the call center I spoke to Mpho Mapatane. This lady does not deserve to be working with people. How she asked the questions was very undermining and rude. What was even worse was that after the call I asked her to transf to a call survey and she lied and told me that Multi choice will send me a link on my sms or e mail to rate her service. I am still waiting as I type this complain. Your staff in general have no customer service. They speak to us as if they are doing us a favour. I just wonder how such a company not have a quality assurance coach because if they do the service we received would be far better.

On the 20/04/2018 i purchased a dstv single view 5S decoder.  a week before on the 15/04/2018 i called in to the call center (using my fiances phone  ********** 275) enquiring about purchasing a new decoder and what it would take and how much would my prorated fee be from the 15th to the 20th of April.(but i was not told that if i purchased a decoder without installation i would need to still get an installer to come in to assist with the installation as i already have a dish and cabling and thought i could just connect my decoder and start watching dstv.)  on Friday 20th April 2018 I called( ********** 475 My Number) in to the call center and spoke to katlego qhoboshiane(who did not ask me about installation or anything of that sort)  i then got home around 10PM that night and tried connecting my decoder only to get an error message about connection by the step 3 of 4(installation wizard)  i then called into the call center to speak to a consultant who could not assist me and a manager who was not understanding my point that i can not pay for an installer to come in as i was not told by any consultant during any of my conversations that i would need an installer to come in to assist with installation even though i had a dish.  i also refuse to pay the R406 that was due yesterday as i have not used the decoder at all as yet and got pathetic service from a manager in the call center insisting that i must pull my own money out to pay an installer to assist with my problem and that he would not be able to assist in pulling the calls i made using my fiances phone , to listen to the calls i made prior to Friday, as she is not a DSTV customer which i feel is nonsense reason being that you should be able to pull any call with any number whether a customer or not (as i know this because i work in a call center).  i would like to receive feed back with my Query ASAP as this service unacceptable.	0	0	0	1	0	1

Two debit orders did not reach my bank (I have proof from FNB that they did not arrive) and I have been disconnected and reconnected umpteen times and I object to all the additional charges specifically an amount that has been added on my February account.

In July one of their accredited installers came to install the explorer, i regret the day that guy came to install it because now since that day i am unable to watch TV but i have been paying all this months. when i try to call the installer his phone is off and when i try to report him to dstv they also cant get hold of him. I have been calling for the past 2 to 3 weeks but till today i cant find any solution	0	0	0	1	0	0

955	/dstv-multichoice/reviews/payment-arrangement-not-honoured-2425327	Payment arrangement not honoured I had a payment arrangement In place which I have honoured and subsequently I have been totally disconnected. I am outraged. I had my services suspended last week as well and a consultant insisted that I still had to pay an amount of R500  even though I paid my payment arrangement amount. The consultant who set up the payment arrangement and the following letter of confirmation both told me I had to pay R1396.10 by 2nd of each month. I paid R1400 on 21 dec as salary was paid early, so how is it that all of a sudden I have to pay more and I have been completely cut off.  This is not fair. If the consultant had told me I had to pay the payment arrangement amount plus another amount I would have done so but I was not told and now in the middle of a month I am told to pay more and then disconnected. I have an email confirming my payment arrangement.	0	0	0	0	1	1

When I called Multichoice on the 30th of January I was advised that I had reversed the debit order . Monday the 1 of February 2016 I went into the bank , FNB , where the bank verified that the funds were not reversed bank into my account that indeed the debit order was successful . The lady I spoke to at Multichoice told me that I must reverse the debit order at the bank and then pay Mulitchoice via transfer since the debit order could not be traced . I then reversed the debit order at the bank on the 1st of Feb and then paid Multichoice via internet banking , well on 5th of February my services were deactivated again , I was advised that I also reversed the internet banking payment I made on the 1st , I have emailed proof of payment , have called my bank , they have confirmed the payment went through successfully to Mulitichoice , my money is missing and I have no DSTV .

961	/dstv-multichoice/reviews/poor-after-sales-customer-services-2714064	Poor after sales customer services Good day,  I am terrible disappointed in DSTV aftermarket customer services, and will surely never use them again after my price lock 24 month contract ends.  Last year between end of October 2018 and beginning of November 2018, I took out a price lock deal with DSTV.  First caller was from their outsource company that wanted to sell the price lock deal (Company situated in Durban) to me, I phoned DSTV with regards to a query to only then find out it is not them directly and that they have the same deal but for less a month. I then returned the outsource company package and request for DSTV to carry on with the price lock deal due to obviously cost savings. I received my package and arrange with DSTV if we can install the dish etc 1 December as we moved to a new house, they had no problem with it and said that I can just phone them as soon as we are ready to do the installation. I then contacted DSTV to give me the supplier contact details to arrange installations Saturday the 1 December 2018.  Firstly I was upset as no one could find my price lock deal I took with them and told me that I am still on a normal contract, I then explain to them when more or less I took the deal.  they said to me that they will get back to me which never happened, I then phoned again with in the same week, they then again couldn't find my price lock deal and according to the customer care department has escalated the situation. I then again never hear anything from them again, I am speaking under correction but I almost sure I contact them 3 time with regard to this situation last year 2018. (I will gladly get my Vodacom bill to confirm the number of calling from my side) this year I received a sms from DSTV saying that my yearly fees will be increasing, I then contact DSTV again, the lady then explain that it is from their price lock department and will get them to call me, I NEVER HEARD anything from them! (Only this week after I had to phone again due to my decoder not working it seems like it was sorted out, but never a word from them)  This week our decoder didn't want to work at all, we then took it in yesterday to their head office, which they exchanged the decoder. My fiancé then asked a question with regards to catch-up as we only have like 5 movies etc we can watch on catch-up. The person who assisted him explained that it can not be correct as there are over 80 movies and that it was installed incorrectly. he then told the (not sure if it was a lady or a man) person that DIKARABO who installed our new DSTV never installed the dish etc only the decoder, as he told us in December that the current dish etc we have installed is still working fine, but  if we ever have a problem he will come to fit the new dish etc. DSTV told my fiancé that we need to contact the supplier as he is paid to do the full installation and he must come and do the installation correctly, we contacted the supplier and he said that we signed the job card and it is only 3 month guarantee on the installation. My husband said to him that he didn't install anything only connected the decoder etc. We then decided to contact DSTV to assist, after being on the line with them for some time they eventually got hold of the supplier, they then also told me that we signed the job card that he check the dish and that its ok, I politely told the lady that there are a HUGE difference between installing and checking. The fact of the matter is that he went back on his word, trying to make us look like we are lying. I told the lady If I can speak to her supervisor the next day as it was getting late, she then said that she will not be available today but will be gladly take my call last night. I then had to hold again for a while only for the consultant to tell me that her supervisor will contact me back after she speak to the supplier to find out what was agreed to... GUES what still now NO ONE phoned me back. I will never suggest DIKARABO (He was also 2hour late the day of our installation with many sorry and excused after he gave us a time he will be there) to anyone as his word is not his HONNOR and DSTV after sales customer service is up to ****!!!!!! After my 24 month price lock deal I will never used them again, they must remember that there are many other ways to watch TV these days, they are not the only provider anymore. We have decided to get another company to assist us even if we already paid for installation which never happened.	0	0	1	1	0	0

964	/dstv-multichoice/reviews/poor-customer-service-2392248	Poor customer service For two months in a row now my DSTV has been disconnected due to non payment. After contacting DSTV twice telephonically I was assured that this will not happen again as the account was paid. On 15.11.2017 I received another sms saying that my service have been suspended due to non payment. I called to find out what was going on and I was told that the sms was send out in error. For 4 days now my DSTV have been disconnected. On 22.11.2017 I contacted DSTV via Facebook because my airtime have been depleted trying to sort out the DSTV issue. According to DSTV my bank reversed R114 on 15.11.17 (the same day I called) as unpaid. The payment I made on 27.10.2017 was for R125, a bank will not reverse a partial payment if the funds did not clear. I have never hear of such bull****. First I was asked for proof of payment which I send, then I was asked for a bank statement so I send one from the 23.10.2017 till 22.11.2017, there are no reversal or unprossed transactions reflecting. Then I was asked to send a bank statement from August 2017 up until now. I refused and asked for the DSTV finance team to do a recon on the account and then to call me to discuss the matter. Up until today I have not received a recon or a call to sort out so I send DSTV another message to say that I am assuming they are not interested in resolving the matter. Again they demanded a bank statement and I was told they cannot recon the account without a bank statement and the statement must reflect the DSTV account number. I have been in Accounts Receivable for many years and know that that is more bull**** and the reference on the bank statement reads Multichoice DSTV which should be sufficient. To me it seems as if DSTV is not interested in doing actual work. I have contacted the bank and looked at the statements for the last 4 months and there are no reversals for funds that did not clear. I am now sick and tired of this back and forth and waste of my time and energy. I demanded that a customer service manager call me to resolve this but I am still waiting. Clearly DSTV is all about collecting money and does not care about their customers or customer service. I will definately take my business elsewhere and I will also share my negative experience on every platform I can.	0	0	1	1	1	0

Please explain to me that if I have price lock on my account and the fee is R 964 and you debit my account with R1500, where does the rest of the money go to? Why not to the box office account? How can my payment of January still not reflect on your system after sending proof of payment? Every time that I phone to get this sorted out I hear please email your details to proof of payment? We'll check your emails and sort it out.  Since July last year I have been paying between R1100 and R1500 and you want to tell me mybox office is in arrears? So where did my money go to?

969	/dstv-multichoice/reviews/poor-refunds-process-1962853	Poor Refunds Process I am so dissatisfied with Multichoice, I even want to give away my Explora. I downgraded my subscription in time, but yet they debit the wrong amount. After a long struggle, I eventually get them to process the refund. But with a shock, They refunded way less than what was supposed to, when I questioned the calculation no one can help me. Then it was said that I need to wait another 7 days for the rest to be refunded, this means I am waiting half a month for one mistake. This is shocking to know that you are loyal payer and supporter but you are not seen that way, just seen as NOTHING. Then they want to say debit orders are better to pay, so take my honest advice, do not do the debit order with Multichoice as they will Steal your money, yes STEAL. Doing a EFT or cash payment means you know you are paying the correct amount instead of losing the money. 	0	0	0	0	0	1

My email had gone through but not a response from anyone at DSTV to acknowledge receipt of my mail nor did they contact me to inform me on delivery of my order.

975	/dstv-multichoice/reviews/poor-service-2957-2027976	Poor Service On 19 March 2016 i went away for the long weekend. When i arrived at my destination i contacted DSTV so that they can enable my secondary decoder because the destination doesnt have a dual feed for my Explora decoder. I asked the lasy to help me and she did. She also said to me that must se leave the other decoder on so i said yes but didnt know it would be charged because she didnt inform met that there will be an extra charge on my account. So came the monday 22 March 2016 i arrived back at my house and immediatly phoned DSTV to change my deciders back to normal. On the 1St April 2016 DSTV deducted an amount of R1910.40 and my normal subscription is R908.00. I immediatly phone multichoice and spoke to Mpo. She advised me that they must go and retreive the original call and that that would take a few days. That was friday and by the tuesday she phoned me back and said that they have reviewed the call and that indeed the consultant didnt advise me that eztra charges will be added on my account and that she should have done so. She asvise me that if i can not wait 12 days for DSTV to return my money i should go and reverse it at my bank. I did that and on the 11th of April 2016 my money was back into my account. I immediatly then paid DSTV R910 which is my monthly subscription which Mpo advised my to. After that during the month of April DSTV suspended my services several time. Everytime i phoned them and they reinstate my services which cost me a phoen call of 20min everytime. On the 4th of May 2016 i got a message from my bank saying a debit order did not go through. It was DSTV for the amount of R1722.33. Again i could not understand why because the issue was resolved and my monthly access fee is R908.00. So i phoned DSTV again. A Sibeko lady helped me. I again explained the whole story to her where she said everytime they have disconected my services they charged me a connection fee. I told her that they can not charge me for something that is not my fault. She said she will go and listen to the call again. Later she phoned me back and said she listened to the call of the 19th of March 2016 and that i am liable for that money. I asked her how can one person (Mpo) and she tell me 2 different things. She just kept on saying that i was happy after the call and that i am liable. I said yes i was happy because nobody told me they are going to charge me R1000 for a long weekend to watch tv. I said to her that then she sould cancel my subscription and she sarcatically agreed and then hung the phone up. So my question is according to the National Credit Act must DSTV not inform me if any extra charges is going to be added on my account and must i not agree on that? And how is that one consultant said they are in agreement that i am not liable and after a month another consultant says that i am liable. As i know all calls is being recorded and the one that Mpo said to me that the lady was supposed to advise me about the extra charges and that they will credit my account for that money. And is that the way the Sibeko lady is keeping DSTV clients and business? I am very unhappy in the service i received. 	1	1	0	0	1	1
976	/dstv-multichoice/reviews/poor-service-4245-2172614	Poor service I have been a loyal customer of Multichoice since 2004. Billing and accounting has been an ossue for many years. I recently found out that i owe them money and therefore they cannot connect another decoder. I find it strange since i pay by debit order and it is therefore up to them to debit the correct amount. They refuse to send me a statement for the past 12 months and said i can find it on the website. The website only allows for 3 months' statement. As i do not receive a monthly statement i cannot analysey account to establish why there is an amount owing. To make matters worse they are deducting R99 from my account every month for Show Max. I did a 7 day free trial and never subscribed. They tell me that they cannot stop it. I also cannot speak to anyone on the phone about it. I must send a mail and hope for the best. This is shocking.

977	/dstv-multichoice/reviews/poor-service-accounts-2-2254989	Poor service - Accounts Its with great regret that I write this. i've been a customer or mutichoise for a few years now with endless problems. i signed up for the price lock packadge last year August 2016. all went well with the payment debit orders up untill i signed up for the decoder insurance plan which they lied about to start off with. The debit order was signed for 949 p.m last month after the decoder insurance was added only R406.00 was deducted. I then called DSTV to report this to them. The guy that helped me advised that he cant solve it from his side but he will sent a mail to the department that shoul handle this complain and the will then get in contact with me. I then had to call them again on the 25.04.2017 regarding this issue. i then spoke to a lady who advised me that there was an oustanding balance on my account of R555. i then advised her to go to my statements and then to tell me where this outstanding amount came from as my account has always been up to date. i do have all of the invoice and there was never an oustanding balance on my account. she then advised me that she will need to sent a mail for somebody to contact me as she cant see where the outstanding amount is coming from. she now advised me as well that a debt order of R1800 has been activated on my account. no one ever called me regarding this either. surelly when an account is outstsanding they would call and inform the client regarding this. the best will be to just cancel this service as no one is ever willing to assist in this regard. pathetic service and then the pride themselves by saying MultiChoice Enriching Lives - DStv Â If only yes	1	0	0	1	0	1
978	/dstv-multichoice/reviews/poor-service-delivery-2332588	Poor service delivery I have two decoders on my subscription with multi choice . When I activated the second package I wasn't happy with the channels on the bouquet and had it downgraded . For the past 3 weeks every week my first decoder gets disconnected with a error code saying I might be in arrears . Every time I call into the call centre They see the mistake on there system and all they do is reconnect me . I asked the agents to please fix the issue so that My decoder isn't disconnected every week . But to no avail.Right now my decoder is disconnected again for the forth time.My payments are up to date but to be treated in this manner is frustrating.	0	0	0	1	1	0
979	/dstv-multichoice/reviews/poor-service-delivery-2648341	Poor service delivery!! The service I've received from multi choice has been disgusting starting from the fact that I waited and entire week for an installer to come and connect my DSTV to the fact that when the installer FINALLY came my account was not activated I've been sitting for the last 8 hours without DSTV. They keep telling to to call back after 2 hours not a single one of them thinks to call me back because the error is on their side. This isn't even a new account I just want to transfer my existing account from one decoder to another so for the last week I've been sitting without my DSTV that I have paid for!!!!! Not a single one of the agents I have spoken to has taken any accountability and not a single one can tell me what the problem is I've been waiting for a manager to call me for the last 40 minutes!!	0	0	1	1	0	0

Im a person who pays my accounts religiously and on time, then my dstv gets put off. When contacting them they say i have an amount outstanding, i send through the proof of payment stating that ive payed my account in full they switch it on. 5 days later the dstv get switched off again and when contacting them it is said i have an amount outstanding, this time the amount has gone up since the last time i contacted them, again i sent through the proof of payment as requested by a consultant with the name Theophilius Mdluli who assured me that sending the proof of payment direftly to hime would clear the problem, ive done so and 2 days later they switch off my dstv and say their is a even higher amaount outstanding.

I now wanted to make a payment for the new month and saw a balance of R 1000, very shocking. I called into the call centre and spoke to Shandre, and she told me I have 2 decoders on 2 packages. I have no idea how this is possible as I only have the 1. The consultant named Shandre, refused to assist and kept saying I have the 2 and I have to pay for the 2. Where does Multichoice get all this from ? I will never pay this amount due for goods I do not have and never have had.

After much consideration I decided to take the Price Lock for the decoder only so I would have the freedom to decide which package I have. Delivery and installation went extremely well received everything within the first week. When the first month arrived to pay, my debit order never went off I had to do a eft for the amount of R1270-00, SO QUERIED about the price explained it was prorata, totally understood that. I specifically told the agent at dstv customer care I did not agree to the R959-00 price lock could they please rectify this, the lady I spoke to her name was Didi, said she would escalate my query to the price lock department, and they would call back and fix this. Needless to say I had to phone 6 times for this matter to be escalated. No one from the price lock department contacted me as yet, beginning of the new month same scenario with regards to payment, phoned 3 times yesterday to get this sorted, no one has phoned me, I get mixed messages from customer care agents, some extremely helpful , and some very rude that does not give you the time of day. The last customer care agent informed me I have an outstanding balance of R4500-00, she could not explain why., promised her supervisor would be in contact with me.

993	/dstv-multichoice/reviews/price-lock-under-delivers-2187643	Price lock under delivers  Beginning of 2016 DSTv introduced dstv price lock with the explora. I immediately signed up thinking what an awesome initiative. Being a movie fan I took interest in DSTv box office which the consultant that helped me set up said all functions would be set up in 24 hours after activation. This however did not happen so I called to get assistance and was told I couldn't be assisted due to the Decoder Payment Plan and was transferred to the relevant department  where I was told the system is offline. I did not react as I understand these things happen. I called a second time and was told the same thing and it sounded as though the consultant I spoke to didn't want to even assist me. I just gave up on this and never called again. I am trapped now because of this price lock to use the explora which I initially bought primarily for box office. Â I would have been happy staying with the 1131 decoder if I knew this is what I was signing up for.	0	0	0	1	0	0

995	/dstv-multichoice/reviews/pricelock-2551315	Pricelock Pricelock complaint We applied for pricelock on 30 June, whereby the application was approved, however we advised the consultant that we only want delivery to take place on 23 July othwerwise we would rather apply at a later stage. The consultant advised that it is not a problem and they can delay the delivery , but we can still continue. Everything was approved. On 3 July all of the sudden without any contact when we got home the decoder was delivered, though we specifically indicated that we want delivery only on 23 July. The day we received the decoder we called immediately and advised we did not want the delivery on that day. So the consultant who took the call advised she will get back to us. After a few follow-ups and calls and numerous attempts to get clarity a manager called us back and advised they will cancel and we can re-apply when we are ready. The cancelation was done under advise by your agrnts and the decoder was collected again. We then called on 20 July to re-apply when we were advised that we don't need to re-apply they will arrange for the decoder to be delivered again. Since then when we call to follow-up we are getting the run around and no-one can give us clarity as to when we can expect the delivery or infact that same was processed. We called on Tuesday spoken to Shereen from pricelock department and same was escallated. Again no feedback. Today we called pricelock spoken to Tebogo who is totally incompatent and advised he will do a new escallation this is the only thing he can do.

Upon installation of the explora I immediately called to confirm same and requested the credit transfer and was told it was escalated so that they will contact me and sort it out. Been 2 weeks, follow up calls (from my side), two disconnection (with reconnection fees) later and matter still not sorted. The pricelock has still not been activated despite numerous calls to do so. Seems that I am now charged normal fees despite having upgraded to the priceloc**** Despite this, my account was debited with R 470 for the extra view which I was told there would be no extra charges as it formed part of the pricelock...apparently not!! Had to pay a futher additional R 420 DESPITE having paid IN ADVANCE on my previous package which is supposed to be cancelled. I’m being charged a reconnection fee every time for Multichoice’s incompetence! Absolutely horrible service! And then they have the nerve to stipulate as part of their pricelock conditions that the contract may not be cancelled within the 2 year period! Something that was supposed to be more cost effective and an easy transition (according to them) is turning out to be an absolute nightmare! Ridiculous!	1	0	0	1	1	1

I receive an SMS now that my DSTv has been disconnected and I need to pay a R50 reconnection fee (which amounts to 50% of my monthly subscription).  So I call the call centre in Johannesburg to ask them what is up and literally 2 days later (without even sending me a warning that payment is late and can only be extended by say 5 days. The woman that answered my call was professional but considering DSTv lost 100,000 subscribers last year, you would think that every customer counts. Instead of saying they will check with their supervisor if the reconnection fee can be waived (which it has been before), their simple attitude is Pay us and go to hell. She said my account was closed and unless I pay R150, it wont come on. No consideration of what the date it today, when was it due, can the reconnection be waived?  DSTv has serious problems! It seems they want to see their demise sooner than the public expect. Very sad attitude to not treat a customer in their own unique right and just willing to lose yet another customer.	0	1	0	0	1	0

1010	/dstv-multichoice/reviews/refuse-to-set-up-debit-order-now-i-get-overcharged-2343874	Refuse to set up Debit Order now I get overcharged!! Good Day  Firstly I would like mention how disappointed I have been with the DSTV Multichoice service as of late. High prices and low quality service. Every month not only do I pay DSTV but I call using my money to solve an ongoing issue that never gets resolved.  I had taken out a payment plan from DSTV in February 2016. It was a price lock option from DSTV for R529 per month. The payment was debit ordered every month. Last year January, I had moved banks so I needed Multichoice to update my bank details which I called in and gave. Since then it has been a nightmare every month as they kept debiting from the closed account and I would then have to call in to give my new details and allocate payment.  Getting DSTV to get my correct account details has been such a mission that eventually I stopped trying after calling every month for the last 8 months. I had been making my payments via EFT since February and I every month I would call in to see if my debit order has been set up and if my payment for the month has been received. This month however, an amount of R925 was debited from my account but the debit order had failed. I called in to ask why was the amount R925 when it should have been R529. I was told it was the wrong amount and someone had added extra charges, which was incorrect and the problem would be sorted. I was then told to call back in after a few days to allocate the payment that I had made for this month since the debit order had failed.   I called in today and the consultant had told me that I am in arrears of R545 because of all the times my payment had been reversed. Firstly, this is unacceptable because I had been calling in every month, sometimes twice a month to update my details and it was falling on deaf ears and nothing was done so I don't think I should be liable to pay for reversed transactions that I have been calling for. Not once during my phone calls did any consultant tell me that my debit order was set up successfully and that I will be charged for failed transactions. Secondly, Multichoice consultants need to do their work properly, as a result of them not doing their jobs, it becomes a problem for the rest of us. It's ridiculous!

I have escalated my query to two different team leaders who promised to resolve my query, this after calling numerous times over a period of two weeks - yet my query remains unresolved and my refund is yet to be processed.

1014	/dstv-multichoice/reviews/ridiculous-service-66-2026083	Ridiculous Service I cancelled my DSTV account for the month of March  and reactivated it about 5 days before the end of March. I've been calling Multi-choice for the whole month of April because my account has been suspended about 10 times. Every time I call in I have explain the situation to a new agent(using my airtime) and all they tell me is that they are INVESTIGATING the matter and for a day or so my account gets re-activated only to be suspended again. I've sent statements showing that I last paid at the end of February and they keep telling me that I was refunded the amount that I paid in Feb which I wasn't. I paid about 450 for April and prorata for March, which I think is also too high, as it was supposed to been the Normal compact rate as well as daily charge for the 5 days in March. The issue here is that to this day my account keeps getting suspended which is ridiculous because I spoke to two supervisors and they also keep telling that that they'll investigate the matter from which I've received no feedback!! it's unacceptable that I have to keep calling DSTV only to be asked for statements and be told that my matter id being investigated when I've been making payments as I'm expected to, yet no one cares to give me the courtesy of a call or email to let me know what the outcome of this investigation is and either way I have to keep making payments to them.

The following month I paid money for downgrade but to my surprise I saw the channels are not downgraded. I called multi choice again. The person I spoke to just agreed that she will do the downgrade. Someone called me from multi choice want me to pay money. I told her that I won't pay the money because I have been misleaded by their consultant.  Now they suspend my services for what?

The agent in question also advised that there is nothing I he could do. Also no senior staff conveniantly was available.   ON advising him that I was allowed to do this previously, he rudely stated that I was lying. I tool exception to this and his attitude and requested to speak to a senior competent person. to which he proceeded to cut the call in my ear.  The call happenedat around 9:10 am to 9:15 am. Fortunatel you should be able to trace the call as I could not get the agents name.  I am asking that immediate disciplinary action be taken against such an arrogant incompetent agent.  A formal apology as well.   Also I demand that my package be downgraded immediately to the compact plus package. I don't buy that it can only be done once a month.

Which I unfortunately failed to do in time the month before - so clearly my intention was to cancel my service!!  Late yesterday I receive an sms stating that my debit order didn't go off on the 1st as \expected\ and they apologise for the error, they have fixed it and the debit order will go off that evening. Who gave them the right to run a debit order that I practically cancelled??  I will reconnect the service when I am ready so fix this NOW before my account gets debited for a service that I do not wish to make use of now. Also, fix the online \self service\ website to work proper and notify the accounts department to cancel debit orders when requested.

About 2 months ago I asked to add another explorer to my account as xtra-view. The call centre said that they would have to replace it with the sd pvr. I asked them that if they do that, would I still be able to swop my sd pvr for an explorer and it was told that I could do so and they would get them to call me regarding the matter. 3 weeks passed and no one contacted me. I again sent sms regarding the swop. I was then contacted and I told them that the pvr had not been used for a while, but they said it was not a problem. The lady was going to contact me the following day to finalise and also give me the names of installers in my area. There was no call the following day, so I contacted On-Air again the following day and was told that the pvr had to be active and I would have to contact Multichoice to confim this. On calling them, they said that the pvr was inactive which means that they could not do the swop. This was not at all what was told to me before. How do we pay for something and then it is expected to just throw it away???	0	0	1	1	0	0

So, after cancelling my DSTV subscription and still being billed for it, I had to phone DSTV to reverse the debit order wrongly taken for March. After a long call, I was given a reference number by Siphelele and told that the refund will be done in 14 days. After 20 days I phoned the call centre again and was told by Tata that nothing was even logged, that the process was not explained or followed correctly and that he would have to start the process all over(this led to him screaming to all his colleagues for a refund template, while I was patiently holding for minutes on end). I explained that I was not happy and he put me through to Dudu who told me that this process would be started again and that it would take another long period of time?? She would, however, talk to her superior and she would get back to me within the day. Nothing! Shame on you Dudu for snickering at your client(yes I could still hear you), for not escalating my request as promised and for not getting back to me as promised!

1026	/dstv-multichoice/reviews/shame-on-you-multichoice-2558019	shame on you Multichoice it is so sad that business is all about money and absolutely nothing else... good service is just a phrase meaning absolutely nothing. I cancelled my dstv debit order in December 2015 due to the fact that they thought they had unfettered access to my account and were putting through unauthorised debit orders. I have since then paid via eft without missing a payment on the 7th of every month. December 2017 and the beginning of january on the 2nd and the 5 they blocked my DSTV. after many phone calls i received a he alf hearted appology and nothing else and the next day they stopped my dstv again, even though I have 5 accounts and pay R3500 per month. I was approached with the price lock offer for the explorer but a condition was I authorized a debit order and from past experience i was loath to do this but agreed. the debit order took 5 min to be in operation and i was advised i would be contacted in 48 hours for the explorer to be delivered and installed or arrangements for it to be concluded. 10 phonecalls later enquiring what was happening as a week had past only to be told the debit order is in place but there is no note for the explorer.i tried speaking to the sales department they are not reachable. what a load of rubbish surely the sales dept must deal with new customers and sales. i was told that there was no order for the price lock deal and that the lady would check and get back to me. I am still waiting. I have since cancelled my debit order due to the lies and deceit of the employees i dealt with. what a crying shame and will be cancelling my other contracts today and will find an alternative to multichoice.	1	0	0	1	1	0

Sometime in March 2018, just like I have done MANY TIMES BEFORE, I contacted Multichoice to make arrangements for my DSTV to be disconnected at month end and it was (just as arranged).   In June 2018, I started receiving on-going calls from a number (at work and on my cell).  When I eventually took one of the calls, I was told that they were debt collectors hired by Multichoice.  I was totally shocked by this and told them they I had personally disconnected the DSTV and I owed NOTHING.  I then called Multichoice and told them the same thing.  Multichoice said they would call me back and I’m still waiting (Multichoice has NO record of this call either!).  I eventually communicated with them on FaceBook Messenger.   5 July (DSTV to me @ 09h39): Hi Fee, Our sincerest apologies for the frustration, do you perhaps have the number, name or company name of the debt collectors? We will send the details to our delisting team to find out if you're in fact listed. With regards to the disconnection, there's no record of a disconnection request, do you remember when you made the request? ~TKM   5 July (DSTV to me @ 09h45): I don't have a clue who they are - other than the ongoing calls during office hours and after hours from telephone numbers  ********** 335 and  ********** 435. I only recall that it was at the of Aussie Masterchef - I think that end at end of April 2018. And if you see from my history, I have suspended my account many times previously - with no issue. I do not understand why this time has resulted in being handed over.   5 July (DSTV to me @ 09h51): The only time your account was accessed was on 30-04-2018, as per business terms, you can only downgrade on your payment day, this means there was no disconnection done on the account as it could've only been done on 26-04-2018. With that being said, the outstanding amount of R 209.77 needs to be settled. ~TKM   5 July (DSTV to me @ 10h04): I dispute this! I called in and asked for disconnection. I did this to coincide with the final Masterchef and it was cut off like clockwork. When I reconnect, I will pay the amount I owe and not before. If DSTV wants to pursue this, they must do what they must do. And we can proceed to Section 65 Court for R209.77! And I will not even consider reconnecting, but move over to the new preferred alternative to DSTV.   5 July (DSTV to me @ 10h23): As advised, no disconnection was requested. You are owing R 209.77 which must be settled. We have no record of a disconnection request on your payment day. ~TKM   After this, the calls from the debt collectors stopped.  On 31 July 2018, I started receiving daily calls again.  This time from 021 and 012 and 031 numbers.  One of the calls came to my desk and I answered.  The person told me that he was calling from Blake & Associates and for security purposes, I needed to provide my ID and full names.  I declined to provide my personal information and he responded that if I did not do this, then he would not be able to tell me what the call was about.  I disconnected the call.  Highly questionable for this kind of information to be requested - especially in this day and age of ID theft and Cyber Crime!  I googled and it seems that these are debt collectors employed by Multichoice.   I take HUGE exception to this!   I DO NOT OWE MULTICHOICE A CENT!!!   That being said, I have gone into my account and according to the information provided there, there are still 24 days left to pay, but they handed me over in June 2018?!  Is Multichoice really battling financially to a point where they are handing customers over for funds that are not owed?  I’m not sure if this is the correct way in which to retain customers.   If they are really battling as they apparently are, then they should be doing everything in their power to RETAIN customers not chase them off to Netflix and the various other Service Providers, who don't rip their customers (or hand them over to debt collectors)!  Notwithstanding all of the above, I contacted Multichoice yesterday to express my dissatisfaction with the manner in which this entire issue has been handled.   It is clear from the response I received that they have absolutely NO interest in resolving this issue amicably.  Clearly the level of customer service has dropped dramatically over the years.  From not having record of my call to disconnect (and placing the blame for this on me), to not having record of my call on 4 July 2018, to having no record of my FaceBook communication with them.  And they really want me to believe that I am to be held accountable for this error of theirs?!  I get spammed by them via email and I get sms'd constantly, but they could not have attempted to make contact with me before they took steps like this?  They now state that they made several attempts to contact me via post (REALLY?!)?  POST?  I NEVER RECEIVED NOT ONE ENVELOPE FROM THEM!  I was debating about  reconnecting or moving to Netflix.  These actions have made the decision for me!  There is no chance that I will ever support Multichoice again.  And I sincerely hope that every customer that is being treated in the same manner, cancels their DSTVs and to those who are going to remain, maybe reconsider staying connected, before you experience the same level of customer service as I have.

When I got home around 5 my service was disconnected and when I called in I was advised to submit proof of payment and call again. I did send the proof and called again only to be told that the system says this account should not be reconnected and the lady said he doesn’t understand why I was told to pay an amount when the system states that I should not be reconnected. And when I asked for reasons none could be provided. When I asked this to be escalated I was put on hold and then told “oh never mind that once you have send the proof of payment it will take 24 hours to reconnect. I regret upgrading and should have stuck with the R29 package because that’s what the Dstv service is worth really.	0	0	0	1	1	0

He tells me there is no catch as they're trying to do away with the older decoders.   Today, 04Sep2018 I take a day off from work to finalise what myself and Tebogo spoke about the previous week, I get to the store wait in-line and tell him I'm here to do the exchange for the decoder. Tebogo tells me that the exchange is possible however i need to pay R650 for both the decoders as my decoder is not insured.   Why do I have to pay so much for something I was told would be free of charge?  What also ****es me off is his sloppy response of there's nothing i can do. Your consultants don't even wear name badges, not even sure he gave me the correct name.  May i please get a way forward with this nightmare as I've already purchased an Explorer decoder and can't install it until I get a secondary decoder for extra view.	0	1	0	0	0	0
1036	/dstv-multichoice/reviews/slow-service-53-1983851	slow service I received a special offer on email 3weeks back for their promotion of PVR lock price special of R899. They asked me to send an SMS they will call back. Till today this DP department of theirs haven't called. 3 days back I called to follow up and this guy Trevor Monana promised that they will call me before end of business day if he channels it himself. Yesterday I called as well to follow up and spoke with a Lady and as well she said in 2 hours they will call me. Lastly today I spoke with another lady and all these people are call centre agents and have no authority to follow up with this DP department. Instead they all send the message on a system..... Which means nothing cause I still don't get help from this DP department. I have all the names and surnames of these call center agents I spoke with. To top it all I spent over 60min with my airtime speaking with all these different people addressing the same issue, cause they are not allow to call people. This means I as a client who needs service from a supplier I should spent those minutes with my airtime and still pay Multi choice Premium charges each month. Very disappointing cause they make a lot of money.	0	0	1	1	0	0
1037	/dstv-multichoice/reviews/sort-out-your-poor-client-facing-trigger-communications-2576657	Sort out your poor client-facing trigger communications This morning I noticed an on-screen message on my TV: This channel is blocked because it may not be part of your package or your services may have been suspended.  I checked online, and discovered that my service had been suspended, despite you receiving my monthly debit order of R1 089 on 25 August 2018.  I called in, and was told there was some sort of mistake since my price lock had come to an end and I had been migrated to the regular premium package. My service was also reconnected.  While on the phone, I received another SMS: Thanks for your DStv payment. We've reconnected your service, but you still need to pay R1 041,64. I checked with the consultant and she said that I was to ignore the SMS.  Now at 13h08, I've received another SMS: We've stopped your DStv as you've not paid. To reconnect, pay R241,64 using ref no. ******xx. Once you've paid, we'll reconnect you. To pay: link  What the hell is happening with my account? It's paid up, so why are you still sending me SMS messages saying that I haven't? Is there a problem on my account, and if so, who is competent enough to tell me what that is?	1	0	0	0	1	1
1038	/dstv-multichoice/reviews/staff-error-2494356	Staff Error We made our payment on the 26 of March, which is about the usual time that our payments are made monthly to Multichoice. No matter how much you pay these people, your account goes into arrears. At the beginning of April we wanted to hire a movie from box office, but because we are cash payers you have to have the available funds to make the booking. So i called multichoice to find out what the status was of my account. The multichoice agent said that my account was in credit for +-R529.00 ...great...miracles do happen. So i asked the agent to transfer that credit amount to the box office account, which she did and I was then able to hire the movies I wanted that evening. Exactly a week later I get a call from Multichoice stating that my account was now in arrears with R227.00. So i explained the above situation to this agent including 5 or 6 of his/her colleagues that have been phoning over the last few weeks. Multichoice has one attitude...multichoice is always right even if they made a mistake and the client is always wrong. So today we made a payment of our instalment which is more than what is requested of me, plus we paid the messed up amount of R227.00, which was not my fault and guess what my service has been cancelled, as I am now in arrears for close to R1000.00, I have no idea where the difference come from...but clearly it must be my fault because I am a cash payer, so they find a way to penalise you for that. Maybe multichoice is a parastatal in disguise, or maybe I am just financing someone else's account. If i have overstated the facts as stated in this post then you have access to the recorded phone calls to verify the facts. btw...still waiting for a supervisor to call me. If the calls are not recorded, I can send you copies of mine.	1	0	1	1	1	1

Gary noted that as per multichoices rules section 7.1.1 they cannot downgrade and will charge me for the whole month even thought I don't require and cannot afford to pay the premium charges for the for month. This is in breach of their rules as paragraph 7.1.1 refers to termination and not downgrades, they do not even define the term of downgrade. I will be referring this to the regulator as it is technically theft of customers hard earned money.Further to the fact the service is pathetic, called in over 3 times???Regards Ms Govender	0	0	0	1	0	0

I got the following email: Kindly pay the amount of R859.07 as soon as possible to avoid a disconnection of the DStv channels and then the amount of R833.50 will be due on the 01 March 2016. SO I paid R859.07 on 27/2, and R920.43 on 29/02 because according to my online profile my bal. was R590.43 and Box office R330. Then on 02/03 a debit order went through on my bank acc for R1449.50. There was no money in my bank acc at that time which mean they cost me R138.00 on magtape unpaid charges!!! And where does this amount of R1449,50 come from? And why on the second when my debit order was suppose to go through on the first?? And I was informed that they can not guarantee that it will go through therefor to keep my side clean I paid via eft.  Now on my online profile my outstanding balance still show the R330 for box office as outstanding?? They are obviously very incompetent not to get this right.  I want the R138 they cost me on bank charges back and this mess sorted!!! This is not acceptable for a big company like this to F*** things up like this!!!

It has been close to two weeks now which we have not been able to have any viewing in the secondary environment and seeing as how we have been paying for this service and have been promised to be contacted on numerous occasions to have this resolved i really dont think this is anywhere in accordance with the Consumer Protection Act   and i would rally hate to be taking my personal time to have to enforce it as this is an unnecessary issue which multichoice can easily resolve...but if this is not resolved and VERY VERY SOON then i would be forced to try by all means to ensure that this is not just made to be a public showing of the disregard that multichoice has for its consumers but also a legal breach of contracts made verbally as well as a breach in the customer service agreements which are not being adhered to.....	0	0	1	1	0	0

I called in as I made payment and had to send proof of payment but required an email address. Every week - religiously - my service was disconnected. And by this time I had emailed the POP to more than one person direct to their email addresses. And each week I had to go through the whole procedure of having to explain the same thing over and over, only to be told the money is not reflecting or it takes longer if an EFT is done from another financial institution, to the finance department did not update the account because the money does not reflect yet - ironically this into week3 of April. This raised my frustration levels to ski high to the point that I became rude, not mentioning my phone bill that was running up. Each time I call I leave messages for someone in a supervisory or managerial position to call me - and no-one calls back. Oh and that is besides the fact that I get sent emails and sms' to inform me that I still owe Multichoice R759.00. I am seriously convinced that the company pays their staff to watch TV the whole day. And to date - still no joy from Multichoice Cape Town.

MutliChoice call center agents and their system are clueless on what they're doing. 2018 I requested to be billed annually, an annual subscription was billed on my account. During the year DSTV debited my account twice. When I called and asked they said their system made an error. I've been calling and asking for refunds till today I'm still waiting.  In Nov I called again requesting that since they over bill me yet I've made annual payments they must put my account back to monthly subscription. December an annual subscription amount was deducted, phoned to enquire they said on the system it says monthly they don't know what happened and a reversal was done 3 weeks later. On Monday the 14 of January 2019 I phoned to check up on my account, and it's still says monthly subscription but the amount to pay counts annually, I asked them to cancel and redo everything, she said she fixed it. This morning when I check balance to pay it still gives me an annual subscription. Like I don't understand do I have to drive to Randburg offices  for DSTV to sort my account out?	1	0	0	1	0	1
1065	/dstv-multichoice/reviews/the-worst-viewing-experience-2640149	The worst viewing experience For the past 5 years I've been a happy and loyal subscriber to DSTV with the normal little standard definition decoder until in Nov 2018 I received an email from DSTV about a new package and a reduced monthly subscription which includes the Xplora 2 decoder with free installation, because of my loyalty (yeah right) however the only condition was paying via debit order, which I then agreed to.  A couple of days thereafter my service got disconnected and I was instructed to pay the connection fee or whatever fee it was, whereas I already made an early payment on 28 Oct 2018. I contested this as this was not the agreement I went into and my service was then activated. A week thereafter my service got disconnected again and I received a bill of about R1000. When I called in, the agent informed me that it was the payment for November and the connection fee of R149. Of course I was now livid as I was much better off when I had the standard decoder with my subscription of R899pm.  Again I contested this and the balance was cleared, however not long thereafter another disconnection with a bill of R1917. I completely lost it and went off at every consultant I got hold off as no one could explain as to what is happening. Eventually I decided enough is enough and asked to be transferred to the retention's department and there I spoke to a very helpful agent by the name of Nompumelelo Mkhize (and I didn't even write down her name). She explained in detail to me what happened and somehow rectified the error. I was debited by the amount of R1917, however I reversed it as I was only supposed to be billed an amount of R839 which is the reduced subscription including extra view and catch up.  Today I went online to make a payment of R839 which is for the month of December and to my surprise I got a bill of R1928 to pay before 07/01/2019. Well it would make sense if it had to be R1678 but where does the amount of R1928 come from? I've been a loyal subscriber for 5 years without any hassle, but this was by far the worst experience I've ever had with DSTV and I would like them to remove whatever was installed and reactivate my standard definition decoder and have my amount to pay rectified.	0	0	0	1	1	1

I was told my premium would be 460 . First month 530 was debited and no sense making explanationwas given.  I paid 460 for2 months after that , then my premium then went up by R20.34 , I decided to change my payment method to cash because I still don't get why my premium changed . I paid the amount multichoice and myself had agreed on which is R460.  Now multichoice is sendingawnzibhe message to pay this R20 before the 27th???   Why am I paying extra???? Until you fix your accounts balance I am paying cash and will only pay 460 until the end of March as agreed...	1	0	0	0	0	1

1071	/dstv-multichoice/reviews/thieving-idiots-2508805	Thieving idiots. I am confused as all hell.  I was on a price lock which came to an end  in FEB. I upgrade and take an new price lock with an explora 2. The installer comes out (when i the account holder is not home) to just swap the old explora for the new and to call DSTV and makes sure it is all set up right.  Somehow  in all of this when the installer is on the phone with DSTV he asks my wife if she wants 'both'' decoders active. She replies yes as he thinks she is answering about the heartbeat decoder (take note my wife is not the account holder). So between all pf this i have two accounts of 900 bucks each (even though only one is installed)  so there is the first **** up. second is when i phone in march cos noticed we have been doubled debited.  Still not resolved.  So DSTV feels they have the right to double debit me on what my wife says in error. so now we repeatedly get disconnected. Which is ironic as now i am paying (as it is a contract) for a service i cannot receive.   Gets better. Wife speaks to Staff Ouma to make payment arrangements. Which we stick to. even email everything to ouma. Dead silence. no reply.  So  we get disconnected again. Wife phones. Now they tell her she cannot make a payment arrangement as she is not the account holder.  So hang the **** on. you will double debit my account based on what my wife says. but you will not allowed her to make payment arrangements?  you okes are thieving idiots.	0	0	0	1	1	1

1073	/dstv-multichoice/reviews/total-incompetence-of-staff-in-dpp-and-finance-department-2283892	Total Incompetence of Staff in DPP and Finance Department I had a price lock contract with DSTV, in 2015 I requested a settlement balance from the call centre due to the fact that I was leaving the country. Â The call centre agents said they were going to escalate to DPP and they will contact me. Â After waiting over a month for them to call me back I left for Canada (at the end of August) and asked my sister in law to try and contact them in my absence and get the settlement balance. Â Finally in November she got a settlement balance and I made the EFT payment from Canada which I still have the proof of payment for. Â I returned from Canada this year and wanted to reconnect my DSTV only to be told that I owe them R15000 for services rendered. Â When I informed the call centre agent that I had paid the settlement balance in 2015 they looked on their system and said they can see the settlement balance was paid but the account was not closed and they need to escalate the query through to the DPP department and they must contact me. Â I waited for the DPP department to contact me which took over a month and when they finally contacted me they said its my fault I didn't call them after paying the settelment balance and tell them to disconnect the service so they left it running. Â So you tell me since when does DSTV ever leave a service running for more than 10 months without receiving payment. Â From experience I know that as soon as you are overdue even 1 day they discontinue the service. Â Do they need me to hold their hand and help them to do their job. Â What does SETTLEMENT BALANCE mean?????? Â I was out of the country in Canada for goodness sake (where I might add that the TV service providers are 100% better and more helpfull and customer focused that damn DSTV). Â I was not receiving the service and now they don't want to reverse these charges, even though they can see on the system and from phone recordings that we requested a settlement balance and the amount they told us was paid in full within days of the balance been given. I think they wanted me to come there and press the disconnect button myself, maybe they don't know how to do their job. DSTV is just as bad as the criminals that steal money from you. Â 	0	0	1	1	0	1

1081	/dstv-multichoice/reviews/unauthorised-debit-order-245-2007298	Unauthorised Debit Order At the end of March, I called the Multichoice call center to take advantage of their special where you pay your fees for the entire year. I was told there was some sort of glitch on my account and so I would need to do an Eft of R8569 and they gave me the banking details. I did the Eft. Suddenly on Saturday, i was called by my bank to say my account is in overdraft. I could not understand why so I went online to check and saw that Multichoice had debited my account R9284. Firstly, I never gave them permission to debit my account and secondly who knows where they came up with that amount. I called the call center and was told it would take seven days to get my money back. What a cheek, they take your money then and there, but want you to wait a week for a refund. All the while, I am in overdraft and have no money to buy food to feed my family!!!! After getting angry, I was told to call my bank and get a refund. So after all that, I must sit on the phone and fix their mistake. Unfortunately, I had no choice, as we needed the money. This has made me so angry that if they do not do something, I will cancel my contract and they can give me all my money back. Disgusting!	0	0	0	0	0	1

1085	/dstv-multichoice/reviews/unbelievable-but-who-cares-2586361	Unbelievable, but who cares After being a premium subscriber for the past 9 year's, it has become very clear that Multichoice doesn't value subscribers, no wonder most people are moving to Netflix and open source providers an option I would have to look at going forward, the reason being is that I was disconnected this morning 2 days before my debit order is processed, without warning from Multichoice, I am even on  price lock plan with them, we called the call center and was met with totally useless staff who speak like automated voices, even though we assured them that the debit order will be paid on the 25th September as always and that there was an error with the debit order on the 25th of August  which we sorted out with our bank, the consultant said to us that the magtape was already sent for payment on the 25th and that if can pay the arrear amount now and then we must reverse the debit order on the 25th and pay the 834 subscription and then call the call center to check if the debit order was still active, so why not just reconnect us for the next 2 days until the debit order is run, but Multichoice refused as customers are not valued and  when I asked the consultant why was I disconnected without notice  or warning on a long weekend as I  received an sms from Multichoice on the 22nd informing me that my account will be debited on the 25th of September for the full amount owing, therefore all should have been in order and the consultant couldnt give me a relevant answer, but it's no skin of my back, we will just take up the 30 day free trial with Netflix anñd stream as we have unlimited internet, and Multichoice will loose another client as we are valued customers to these scavengers whom I have always defended when people ask we why I still have Dstv, I believe in investing in our economy but it goes unappreciated by people like Multichoice as you are just another number in the queue, so people weigh your optimus wisely as Multichoice will just kick you to the curb as and when they want without warning or care and even though we pay a premium price for service Multichoice doesn't even bother sending a statement which I have requested numerous of times to be sent to me via e-mail, this is a requirement by law, but corrupt Multichoice doesn't follow the laws of this country, their bottom line is far more important	0	0	0	0	1	0

1088	/dstv-multichoice/reviews/unethical-behaviour-2452651	Unethical Behaviour Complaint – DSTV recorder regularly rescans at set times – just like clockwork Complaint 2 – 22nd February Account  ********** 4956 For several weeks my decoder automatically rescans at set times and it’s getting worse. Today, just like clockwork, the decoder worked ok all day, until it started the rescan programme at 16h30, 18h05, 18h40, 19h05, 20h40, 21h05, then I got fed up and turned the TV off. Again, this is very suspicious!!!  To reiterate, I am 100% sure the decoder equipment is sound. I bought it new from DSTV. It is a very simple piece of kit. I believe it is the software and data that DSTV provides that causes the rescans. In fact, I believe it is done on purpose to force me to upgrade to an explora. I believe this because I used to be a computer programmer and understand these things. DSTV put something in the code to rescan when it receives a certain command. I know this is dishonest, however as I said I’m a computer programmer, so in legal terms would this be regarded as fraud, or is it extortion. Very hard to prove I know, however I believe someone out there knows what’s going on and will spill the beans soon. So, DSTV stop these rescans. You provide the software so take out the rescans, put in better error recovery. I pay R809 every month for what is becoming a joke. Do I really have to spend more money to get a decent service? In looking through the internet I have noticed many reports of decoders that rescan frequently and suspiciously. I think this is a wider issue than appears.  I will continue to report this issue every day.	0	0	0	1	0	0

Its always a bad impression when we need to write such reviews on businesses as we are paying clients.  I spoke to 2 individuals today(09:00am) : Thandolwetu Zulu who was apparently the manager of the department and he was suppose to arrange my re-fund before EOB today, i mean its only R125.00.  I then spoke to a lady called Nomfundo Skota who is  normal consultant and she was sooo rude and she forgets that she is not doing anyone any favours i mean we are paying clients and I requested for the CALL REFERENCE  FOR THE CALL WE HAD AND SHE REFUSED TO AND TO MY UNDERSTANDING AND ALSO HAVING A BACKGROUND ON CALL CENTER PROCEDURES THE CLIENT SHOULD BY ALL MEANS BE PROVIDED WITH THE CALL RECORDING OF ANY CALLS BEING MADE TO YALL CALL CENTER SO ANOTHER RED-FLAG,but am sure am not the first and surly wont be the last one complaining about the Call Center staff as its just an ongoing thing as its way easy to treat someone like ****** over the phone if these consultations were done face to face then verdict would be different  Basically long story short i paid my monthly subscription*(R385.00)* 5-days before(26th of April) my actual payment date(2nd of every month), so i was told that due to the fact that i paid before my actaul date which is on 2 of every month, they charged me a re-connection fee which was R60.00 and also i was charged R75.00 for Prorata of which i was never informed about such and then i was told thats How DSTV works is pre-paid so meaning you pay for what you watch fine taken and then i was told about an amount of R85.00 apparently that was the amount that was due on the account of which i also dont know how they got that , so now i requested for the Terms&Conditions to be email to my email address : *Marcusgavey007@gmail .com* within an hour and still have not received anything so just to show that they think we are not educated or informed about things, if this is the way ordinary clients are treated am just afraid what about the Senor Citizen or the Older generation that is not informed meaning that they also find themselves paying MORE due to the fact that they are not well informed.  I do not live life to sit and write unnecessary reviews over such things, we have things to do and if a simple thing like this can not be resolved then it makes you wonder if they do really  care about the clients. This is not a THREAT and trust me i wont let it end here if nothing is done within 24hrs, i will make it a point that any other person that works hard for they hard-earned money never faces such experiences, its only R125.00 i know its nothing but i worked hard for that money.	0	1	0	1	1	1

After having my dstv connection cut, I called into the call centre to find out why it is was that my debit order didn't go through & why was my connection cut as a result. The call centre agent was not sure why but noticed that there was definitely something peculiar with my account as a signal could not be sent to my primary decoder. My account was flagged as an unfair Disconnection and escalated. Even after making payment, my account has still not been reconnected. Each time I call into the call centre, I'm told my account is being escalated. It's been 2 weeks that my account has been disconnected.

1100	/dstv-multichoice/reviews/upgradedowngrade-conundrum-2412769	Upgrade/Downgrade conundrum I'm very disappointed in DSTV.  They just can never get a upgrade / downgrades correct.  Last night i spend 30min on the phone on my cost to get them to go and listen to my recording and then admit, AGAIN, a fault from their side.  Last year i had this issue - got fedup and boycott DSTV and downgraded and stayed on DSTV ACCESS.  In October 2017 i had a similar problem again.  I upgraded for the rugby and DSTV auto sets the downgrade to happen on your next debit order date.   I get paranoid everytime i do this as i know there will be issues and true as bob, there is.  This time around they upgraded me fine, that ALWAYS works, Upgrades when they get more money is no hassle.  Then when dt order run comes, they downgraded me to DSTV Compact and not ACCESS. It took me 30min to get that corrected and DSTV to admit after the recording that they are AGAIN at fault.  I mean come on.  Rather not offer the service if you have either 1) untrained people, 2) perhaps not the infrastructure to handle this.  DSTV, you have failed me AGAIN and i bet you this is NOT the LAST time.  I so wish for SA to get another Sports service provider so i can never make use of your service again.  Now the standard reply will be, We are so sorry for any inconvenience caused and we will take the matter further.... bla bla bla    Rather with this Standard REPLY go and do something about this actually. Find out the person and cause. As a premium client you have lost me long time ago.  I only do upgrades perhaps twice a year so you are already loosing money. You will cause this to be permanent soon and when i decide enough is enough, then you will not EVER get a cent from me again.	0	0	0	1	0	0

Note that this is a new account,  and that her proof of address does not match this fake incorrect address. Now they are saying the hold up is that customer needs to provide forms.  This is ridiculous. I can see why so many people are switching to other options because this process in this century is insane. Can someone please contact her to sort this out today!

This is one of the perks that were sold to me when I took the account, however to this day this inability to access  Box Office has still not been resolved.  I have written complaints, called, tweeted and I do not get assistance.  Today, I spoke to a very rude call center agent who had the gall to tell me  Actually you do not pay for this service, it is an additional    Well ***** you and your additional. If you sell customers a product and tell them that it includes a particular perk, then you have to deliver on that promise   She even goes on to take my number, email address and tells me that I will be called at 18h00 today to resolve this.  It I'd 23h13 and no phone call received.  Besides the fact that the product I was sold is not living up yo it's promise, the service is nothing to write home about either.  How can a customer complain continuously for months without their issue getting resolved?  You really need to train your staff in customer service and learn to live up to the promises you make to your customers.  Your service is ****!	0	1	1	1	0	0

Every time I call there's a different story. I called last week and the week before and both consultants apologise for the delay and that they have escalated my query.Apparently someone was supposed to contact me regarding the R149 that I must pay via debit order before the decoder will be delivered. Yesterday I called again and the agent said to me that my offer expired and my application must be resubmitted again. I really can't believe it, this is really disgusting and VERY BAD SERVICE. I really don't know what to do anymore. Can someone in a more managerial position please assist me in this regard. It's been almost three months since my initial application.

1109	/dstv-multichoice/reviews/very-bad-service-from-multichoice-2504679	Very bad service from multichoice. My mother called MultiChoice to apply for a price lock. Fiirstly she told them that a third party will be paying for the account which is myself, they told her to send some docs but did not tell her to fill in a third party form, next thing after sending the docs she had to call them after about four days to ask if they received the docs because nobody has called her yet like how it is said on the email, only then they told her that she must quote the number on the email they sent and the consulatnt she spoke to said she will then send it to her manager and she will receive a call and no timeframe was given. My mother had to call them again since she did not receive a call after another three days and only then they told her she has to download a thirdparty form from thier website. My mother did that and sent all the docs required again, still multiChoice did not call her, she had to call them and ask for an update, only then they told her that her application has expired and she has apply all over again. All the people my mother spoke to did note have the time to explain everything on one call  in order to complete the application, they say it takes three days for them to get back to you after they have received the email but they don't. My mother called the head office to complain about the service but the consulatant she spoke did not take the complaint serioulsy and only told her she will have to send her details for a call back to redo the application. She asked her after how long are they going to call, she said about three working days. It's now been 6 days and still no call from multichoice. How long do we have to wait to apply for a simple thing like this, their service is really bad they are not informative and they do not tell what to do all at once, My mother repeatedly asked the first consultant she spoke to after telling the things she needs to send if that was all she needs to do and she said yes. We had never had to experience such bad service from such a trusted brand.	0	0	1	1	0	0

But guess what; it was not done after having confirmed twice in August 2018 with the Dstv call center that my request has been activated. On the occasions I phoned multichoice call center none of the agent picked up my noto e to downgrade so I had to go through the process again and again. Well you only get service when you want to upgrade with Multichoice Dstv. My take is Multichoice excells in poor service.	0	0	0	0	0	1

1112	/dstv-multichoice/reviews/very-unhappy-client-and-disappointed-i-feel-robbed-by-multichoice-2707286	Very unhappy client and disappointed. I feel robbed by Multichoice! I joined Multichoice Dstv services in 2016 on a contract Pricelock. My contract expered end of January 2019. At first I was not aware that my contract is expired, I realised when the services was disconnected. I thought maybe the debit order didn't go through, I them went to Pick'n Pay to pay, to my surprise they said I need to pay R141. 00. I paid but the service were still disconnected, I then called customer service, that's when I was told that my contract had ended. On the 26th of February, I then went to Dstv agency at Calsworld Midrand. I was given options and I chose premium package and I paid for the premium package and the connection fee. Services were connected, even better now that am on a better package. My next debit order will go of on the 25th. Agreed.   Then on 08th of March my services were disconnected, I was surprised. I called customer service, the consultant, said I am sorry mam, your services were not supposed to be disconnected, you owe R49.00. I asked how come I owe that amount, she said it was a connection fee, yet I paid that amount when I was taking a new package. she then reconnected.  On 18th March, my services were disconnected. I call again, spoke to a consultant that was so not helpful, she told me she can't speak for other people what they told me. Now I am told I owe R487. 88. I asked how do I get to owe such. I couldn't get a proper answer. I then asked for the manager, I was referred to a supervisor, Abraham who was supposed to contact me back and never did till I called I again after 1hour. I asked to speak to a supervisor and Fahed was the supervisor who called. He told me that it's a mistake on their side, my services will be reconnected, he apologized.  The R487. 88 will be corrected.  On the 22rd of March my services were disconnected again, I call. I am told I owe R1386. 88. Okay now I asked for the supervisor that never called, I called at 8h28 am. I then went to the Dstv Agency at Calsworld, spoke to the manager, he said he look at my account and contact me after 12pm as there was a load shading. I never got any call.   I then called at about 8pm. I spoke to a supervisor Rebecca. She kept me on the for over an hour.  First she told me that I owe money from 2016...and then she went on to say I owe from November 2018...and then it's an outstanding amount from my previous contract. I still did not understand what exactly is going on.  I had just upgraded to a better package because I wanted to enjoy it. I have not been given opportunity to do so. I paid for my services and all am getting is this unhealthy service. I get to be told different stories by each an every person I communicate with.  I have contacted the customer service again as I want the matter to be resolved, over and above the fact that I was told that I will get a call from Multichoice this morning. I called and I am told a manger will contact me. I called at 8h39am..its over an hour and 30mins been waiting for the manager by the name of Malakhiwe Vamba to contact.  This is not what I have signed up for. Even when you make a mistake, it can't be 3 times and with different stories.	1	0	0	1	1	1

They cannot seem to tell me what is due on my account (which is in fact, between us on a zero balance) ... hilarious.

They constantly guarantee me that the matter has been escalated and I would receive a phone call within 24 hours.  It has now been 13 days, and guess what... I haven't received a single call back.  not even after speaking to several supervisors, did I get any response.  I have had  tremendous  cell phone call expenses, having to contact them daily, sometimes even up to 3 times a day.  To top it all, my debit order details was not even loaded (they do not even have my banking details on the system,  after confirming that they received my debit order request form) and I had to pay via EFT.

I have my rights and you must reprimands the person on your side how did that mistake. please investigate and come back to me my number  ********** 223.	1	0	1	0	0	1
1130	/dstv-multichoice/reviews/wrong-information-due-to-errors-2627174	Wrong information due to errors So I contacted DSTV call center yesterday as I would like to make a payment and reconnect my service. There was an automated response saying I need to pay R338,62 for my service to be reconnected and then the next payment will be 25 December 2018, I then ended the call and phoned again as I know with DSTV they always have different amounts and this time I recorded the call that said the same thing on how much I owe and a SMS with the amount was sent and a link to do the payment. After that I called to speak to a consultant who was arrogant and rude as hell and I explained to her my frustration and she started getting a attitude.   She then told me I need to pay R938,62 and I refuse to pay this amount as the SMS and recorded line I have states clearly what I need to pay and she advised that there is a system error and has been happening  a lot. Once there is a system error you as DSTV need to remove that error with immediate effect and now you want me to pay extra because of your system error I will be taking this further with my recorded call of the automated response as well as the recorded call with your arrogant and down right rude consultants. You guys should be ashamed of the bad service delivery you have and making the customers pay for them.	1	1	0	0	1	1
